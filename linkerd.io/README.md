## Website assets

Please do not put files in the `static` directory that are referenced on
linkerd.io. This directory is reserved for assets that are used as external
resources. If you need to add images for a page, please add them in the
[page bundle](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/).

**Note:** Images in page bundles that have a width or height larger than 2400
pixels will be downsized.

## Tasks

### Creating a blog post

To create a blog post, start by creating a blog post folder in the `blog`
directory using the following format: `/blog/YYYY/MMDD-title/`. For example:
`/blog/2024/0102-my-blog-post`.

Next, create an `index.md` file in the folder with the following frontmatter:

```yaml
title: # The title of your blog post
description: # The description of your blog post
date: # The date of your post in the format: `2024-01-01T00:00:00Z`
slug: # The URL slug for the page. Only set this param if you want to use a different slug than the title.
keywords: [] # An array of keywords are used to relate blog posts
params:
  author: # The author of the blog post
```

#### Assigning an author

There are 2 ways to assign an author to a blog post.

1. If the author has more than one blog post, the author data should be defined
   in `data/authors.yaml`, then the author id can be set in the frontmatter
   params. For example:

```yaml
params:
  author: william
```

2. If the author is only going to have a single blog post, the author data can
   be set inline if desired. For example:

```yaml
params:
  author:
    name: Author name
    avatar: avatar.png
```

For inline author data, the avatar image can either be a page resource or a
remote image. To use a remote image, simply provide the full url to the image,
and Hugo will download and resize it when the site is published. For example:

```yaml
params:
  author:
    name: John Smith
    avatar: https://example.com/avatars/john-smith.png
```

**Note:** If an author only has a single blog post, but there's a chance they
will have more in the future, please not use the inline method.

#### Cover, thumbnail, and feature images

To associate a cover, thumbnail, or feature image to a blog post, you do not
have to specify them in the frontmatter. You can simply name them `cover`,
`thumbnail` or `feature`, place them in the blog post folder, and they will
automattically be used. For example:

```text
blog/
└── 2024/
    └── 0102-my-blog-post
        ├── cover.jpg
        ├── index.md
        └── thumbnail.jpg
```

If a blog post is featured, by default, the cover image will be used on the blog
list page. If a cover image is not present, or you would like to use a different
image than the cover image, you can name it `feature` and place it in the blog
post folder.

If a thumbnail image is not present in the blog post folder, the thumbnail image
will be created from the cover image. By default, the thumbnail image will be
cropped and resized into a square. If you would like to maintaining the original
aspect ratio, you can set the `thumbnailProcess` frontmatter param to `fit`. For
example:

```yaml
params:
  thumbnailProcess: fit
```

You can automattically show the cover image at the top of the blog post by
adding the `showCover` frontmatter param. For example:

```yaml
params:
  showCover: true
```

If you need to name your images another way, you can reference the image names
in the frontmatter:

```yaml
params:
  thumbnail: square.png
  cover: hero.png
  feature: hero-cropped.png
```

#### Open graph images

By default, the first 6 images from the `images` array are used when the blog
post is shared on social media. For example:

```yaml
images: [social.png]
```

If the images array is empty, images with names matching `feature`, `cover`, or
`thumbnail` will be used in that order.

#### Markdown images

All images that you want to include in your markdown content should also be
placed in the blog post folder and referenced using a markdown image syntax. For
example:

```markdown
![Alt text](my-image.jpg)
```

To dispplay a caption below the image, provide an image title. For example:

```markdown
![Alt text](my-image.jpg "My image caption")
```

### Hiding pages in the docs sidenav

_(docs page only)_

A page can be prevented from showing in the sidenav by setting the `unlisted`
frontmatter parameter. The page will be hidden in the sidenav, but can be linked
to externally or from some other page.

```yaml
---
params:
  unlisted: true
---
```

**Note:** Setting this parameter **does not** prevent the page from being shown
on the search results page, or search engines from indexing the page.

### Hiding page from search engines

A page can be prevented from being shown on the search results page, and indexed
by search engines by setting the `noIndex` frontmatter parameter.

```yaml
---
params:
  noIndex: true
---
```

**Note:** Adding this param will cause `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">`
to be added to the `<head>` of the page. It **does not** add the URL of the page
to the robots.txt file.

### Disabling the copy button in codeblocks

Highlighting in code fences is enabled by default. A Copy button will
automatically be added to every highlighted codeblock. If you wish to disable
the copy button for a single codeblock, you can do so by adding the
`disable-copy` class attribute after the language identifier.

```
bash {class=disable-copy}
```

### Creating a new major version

To create a new major version for the Linkerd docs, follow the steps below. As
an example we suppose the latest major is `2.16` and we'd like to create docs
for the upcoming `2.17` version, that will appear at `https://linkerd.io/2.17`.

- Clone the `https://github.com/linkerd/website` repo
- Create a new branch `yourusername/2.17`
- Make sure all the links in the edge version (`2-edge`) are relative and don't
  have the version hard-coded. E.g. `(/../cli/install/#)` instead of
  `(/2-edge/reference/cli/install/#)`.
- Update the latest version in `linkerd.io/config/_default/params.yaml`:
  `latestMajorVersion: "2.17"`
- Update the `docs` menu in `linkerd.io/config/_default/menu.yaml` to include a
  menu item for `2.17`.
- Create an entire new directory, copying the edge docs:
  `cp -r linkerd.io/content/2-edge linkerd.io/content/2.17`. Any upcoming doc
  changes pertaining to `2.17` should be pushed against that new directory and
  the `2-edge` directory.
- Add a row to the Supported Kubernetes Versions table in
  `linkerd.io/content/2.17/reference/k8s-versions.md`.
- Generate the CLI docs with `linkerd doc > linkerd.io/data/cli/2-17.yaml`
- Push, and hold the merge till after `2.17` is out.
- After merging, update the Cloudflare redirection rule so `/2` points to
  `/2.17`:
  - Click on the `linkerd.io` site
  - Click on the `Rules`section
  - Update the rule `https://linkerd.io/2/*` so that it points to
    `https://linkerd.io/2.17/$1`
