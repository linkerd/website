Application failure injection is a form of chaos engineering where we
artificially increase the error rate of certain services in a microservice
application to see what impact that has on the system as a whole. Traditionally,
you would need to add some kind of failure injection library into your service
code in order to do application failure injection. Thankfully, the service mesh
gives us a way to inject application failures without needing to modify or
rebuild our services at all.

One hallmark of a well structured microservice application is that it can
tolerate failures of individual services gracefully. When these failures are in
the form of services crashing, Kubernetes does a fantastic job of healing these
failures by creating new pods to replace the ones which have crashed. However,
failures can also be more subtle, causing services to return an elevated rate of
errors. These types of failures cannot be automatically healed by Kubernetes but
can still cause a loss of functionality.

## Using the Traffic Split SMI API to inject errors

We can easily inject application failures by using the [Traffic Split
API](https://github.com/deislabs/smi-spec/blob/master/traffic-split.md) of the
[Service Mesh Interface](https://smi-spec.io/). This allows us to do failure
injection in a way that is implementation agnostic and works across service
meshes.

We do this by first deploying a new service that returns only errors. This can
be as simple as an NGINX service that is configured to return HTTP 500 responses
or can be a more complex service which returns errors specifically crafted to
exercise certain conditions you wish to test. We then create a Traffic Split
resource which directs the service mesh to send a percentage of a target
service's traffic to the error service instead. For example, by sending 10% of a
service's traffic to the error service, we have injected an artificial 10% error
rate into that service.

Let's see an example of this in action using Linkerd as the service mesh
implementation.

## Example

We'll start by installing the Linkerd CLI and deploying it on our Kubernetes
cluster:

```bash
> curl https://run.linkerd.io/install | sh
> export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.linkerd2/bin
> linkerd install | kubectl apply -f -
> linkerd check
```

Now we'll install the booksapp sample application:

```bash
> linkerd inject https://run.linkerd.io/booksapp.yml | kubectl apply -f -
```

One of services in this application has been configured with an error rate. The
whole point of this demo is to show that we can inject errors without needing
any support for this in the application, so let's remove that configured error
rate:

```bash
> kubectl edit deploy/authors
# Find and remove these lines:
#        - name: FAILURE_RATE
#          value: "0.5"
```

We should now see that the application is healthy:

```bash
> linkerd stat deploy
NAME             MESHED   SUCCESS      RPS   LATENCY_P50   LATENCY_P95   LATENCY_P99   TCP_CONN
authors             1/1   100.00%   6.6rps           3ms          58ms          92ms          6
books               1/1   100.00%   8.0rps           4ms          81ms         119ms          6
traffic             1/1         -        -             -             -             -          -
webapp              3/3   100.00%   7.7rps          24ms          91ms         117ms          9
```

Now we can create our error service. Here I will use NGINX configured to respond
only with HTTP status code 500. Create a file called `error-injector.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: error-injector
  labels:
    app: error-injector
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: error-injector
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: error-injector
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:alpine
          ports:
          - containerPort: 80
            name: nginx
            protocol: TCP
          volumeMounts:
            - name: nginx-config
              mountPath: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
              subPath: nginx.conf
      volumes:
        - name: nginx-config
          configMap:
            name: error-injector-config
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: error-injector
  name: error-injector
spec:
  clusterIP: None
  ports:
  - name: service
    port: 7002
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: nginx
  selector:
    app: error-injector
  type: ClusterIP
---
apiVersion: v1
data:
 nginx.conf: |2

    events {
        worker_connections  1024;
    }

    http {
        server {
            location / {
                return 500;
            }
        }
    }
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: error-injector-config
```

And deploy it:

```bash
> kubectl apply -f error-injector.yaml
```

Now we can create a traffic split resource which will direct 10% of the books
service to the error service. Create a file called `error-split.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: split.smi-spec.io/v1alpha1
kind: TrafficSplit
metadata:
  name: error-split
spec:
  service: books
  backends:
  - service: books
    weight: 900m
  - service: error-injector
    weight: 100m
```

And deploy it:

```bash
> kubectl apply -f error-split.yaml
```

We can now see a 10% error rate for calls from webapp to books:

```bash
> linkerd routes deploy/webapp --to service/books
ROUTE       SERVICE   SUCCESS      RPS   LATENCY_P50   LATENCY_P95   LATENCY_P99
[DEFAULT]     books    90.66%   6.6rps           5ms          80ms          96ms
```

We can also see how gracefully the application handles these failures:

```bash
> kubectl port-forward deploy/webapp 7000 &
> open http://localhost:7000
```

Not very well, it seems!  If we refresh the page a few times, we will sometimes
see an internal server error page.

We've learned something valuable about how our application behaves in the face
of service errors so let's restore our application by simply deleting the
traffic split resource:

```bash
> kubectl delete trafficsplit/error-split
```

## Conclusion

In this post, we demonstrated a quick and easy way to do failure injection at
the service level, by using the SMI APIs (as powered by Linkerd) to dynamically
redirect a portion of traffic to service to a simple "always fail" destination.
The beauty of this approach is that we are able to accomplish it purely through
SMI APIs, and without changing any application code.

Of course, failure injection is a broad topic, and there are many more
sophisticated approaches to injecting failure, including failing certain routes,
failing only requests that match a certain conditions, or propagating a single
"poison pill" request through an entire application topology. These  types of
failure injection will require more machinery than what is covered in this post.
