Today we're happy to announce the release of [Linkerd
2.4](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/stable-2.4.0). This
release adds **traffic splitting** and **Service Mesh Interface (SMI)
support**, graduates high-availability support out of experimental status, and
includes a tremendous list of other improvements, performance enhancements, and
bug fixes.

(And did I mention Linkerd recently [passed its third party security
audit](https://twitter.com/wm/status/1144746496807428096) with flying colors?)

Linkerd's new traffic splitting feature allows users to dynamically control the
percentage of traffic destined for a service. This powerful feature can be used
to implement rollout strategies like canary releases and blue-green deploys by
incrementally shifting request traffic between Kubernetes services.

Support for the [Service Mesh Interface](https://smi-spec.io/) makes it easier
for ecosystem tools to work with Linkerd. This is already paying dividends:
we're happy to report that [Flagger now supports
Linkerd](https://docs.flagger.app/usage/linkerd-progressive-delivery)!
[Flagger](https://github.com/weaveworks/flagger) is a progressive delivery
operator that combines metrics and traffic splitting, and a great example of
the sort of higher-order operations that the service mesh unlocks. (The Linkerd
team is [the largest contributor to
SMI](https://linkerd.io/2019/05/24/linkerd-and-smi/), so we're excited to see
this coming together so nicely.)

Finally, Linkerd 2.4 graduates the high availability (HA) control plane mode
out of experimental status into a fully production-ready feature, and
introduces a host of other improvements, performance enhancements, and fixes,
including:

- A new `linkerd edges` command for auditing TLS and identity of connections
  between resources
- A two-phase installation process that splits cluster-level and
  namespace-level privilege requirements, for security-conscious Kubernetes
  adopters who don't let just anyone change things on the cluster.
- A *debug sidecar* for easier inspection of pod traffic
- A fresh security audit from [Cure53](https://cure53.de/), passed with flying
  colors
- And much, much more--read the full [Linkerd 2.4 Release
  Notes](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/blob/main/CHANGES.md#stable-240) for
details!

Linkerd 2.4 is our third major release of 2019. Earlier this year, [Linkerd
2.3](https://linkerd.io/2019/04/16/announcing-linkerd-2.3/) enabled mutual TLS
by default, making authenticated, confidential communication between meshed
services the norm for all Linkerd users. In February, [Linkerd
2.2](https://linkerd.io/2019/02/12/announcing-linkerd-2-2/) introduced
automatic retries and timeouts, adding powerful reliability mechanisms that
allow Linkerd users to automatically recover from many of the partial failures
endemic to distributed systems.

We'll be discussing the fun features in 2.4 and the plans for 2.5 in our [next
Linkerd Online Community
Meeting](https://www.meetup.com/Linkerd-Online-Community-Meetup/events/262624182/)
later this month. Be sure to join us there.

Ready to try Linkerd? Those of you who have been tracking the 2.x branch via our
[weekly edge releases](https://linkerd.io/2/edge) will already have seen these
features in action. Either way, you can download the stable 2.4 release by
running:

```bash
    curl https://run.linkerd.io/install | sh
```
