Missed the last Linkerd Community Meeting? No worries. Here’s a recap plus the
recording.

## News & updates

Linkerd 2.10 is now available and is the lightest it has ever been. Many of the
previous defaults are now extensions, providing users with a lot more control.
We have also released the 21.3.4 edge release – please check it out and provide
feedback!

Another really big piece of news is that Linkerd submitted its CNCF graduation
application. Stay tuned for more news on that!

## Linkerd roadmap

We are setting the stage for policy in 2.11 and will continue consolidating
control plane components. Join our [next community meeting](https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-linkerd-community-presents-april-linkerd-online-community-meetup/)
for more details.

## What's new with Linkerd 2.10

In 2.10, we've modularized the control plane. Users can now choose between
multiple opt-in extensions; gaining more control over their service mesh
implementation and making Linkerd even more lightweight. We also added opaque
ports to extend Linkerd’s coverage to certain situations that are incompatible
with protocol detection. Finally, we extended multi-cluster to all TCP
connections. Learn more in [our blog post on the release](https://linkerd.io/2021/03/11/announcing-linkerd-2.10/).

## Linkerd Heroes

This month we nominated four great Linkerd Hero candidates: Fredrik Klingenberg
and Henry Hagnas for sharing their amazing Linkerd story; Christian Hüning for
always jumping in on the Linkerd Slack to answer questions and help fellow
Linkerd adopters; and Manyak for his great code contributions. As always, it was
a close call but in the end, the community voted for Mayank – congrats!  👏👏👏
