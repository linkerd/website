Today we're excited to announce the creation of the Linkerd Steering Committee.
This marks an important milestone in Linkerd's commitment to our users and to
open governance. We'll be kicking off our first steering committee meeting in
February, and all are welcome to attend.

## Why add a steering committee?

Linkerd is a unique project. In a space that's known for complexity and hype,
Linkerd stands for simplicity, minimalism, and solving concrete problems. We've
never been unafraid to [buck cloud native
trends](https://linkerd.io/2020/12/03/why-linkerd-doesnt-use-envoy/) when it's
right for our adopters, and despite all the noise, [Linkerd adoption continues
to grow rapidly](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md). So
why add a committee?

The first reason is project growth. Over the past year, Linkerd adoption has
expanded to include many organizations around the globe, from large enterprises
like [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com), [H-E-B](https://heb.com),
[EverQuote](https://everquote.com), and [HP](https://hp.com), to fast-moving
startups like [finleap connect](https://connect.finleap.com/),
[Subspace](https://subspace.com/), and [Clover
Health](https://cloverhealth.com/). As the community has grown, so has the task
of gathering, collating, and prioritizing feedback. As representatives of the
"voice of the user", the steering committee will play a vital role in helping
the maintainers prioritize Linkerd's ever-advancing roadmap.

The second reason is to broaden the set of ways that end users can
get involved in the project. Linkerd's adopters are often busy practitioners
who use Linkerd to run mission-critical systems around the world. The common
ways of giving back to an open source project—crafting PRs, writing blog posts,
answering community questions—never mind [becoming a
maintainer](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md#becoming-a-maintainer)!—can
be challenging. The steering committee provides a formal but
low-time-commitment venue for practitioners to provide feedback on what they're
seeing in their own systems today, and what they'd like to see in the
future—incredibly important information for the project.

## What will the steering committee do?

Of course, Linkerd isn't the first open source project to add a steering
committee.  Several projects in the cloud native space (notably, fellow CNCF
project [Kubernetes)](https://github.com/kubernetes/steering) have implemented
steering committees to great success. These committees often serve a variety of
functions, from handling assignment of marketing and non-technical tasks to
providing a forum for competing vendors with vested interests in the project.

But Linkerd is a unique project, so it should come as no surprise that
Linkerd's steering committee is also unique. The Linkerd Steering Committee has
one simple goal: _to ensure that Linkerd meets the needs of its current and
future users_. Thus, rather than representing vendors, Linkerd's steering
committee members represents Linkerd users. Members of the Linkerd Steering
Committee will work with maintainers to ensure that Linkerd's roadmap is always
focused on solving concrete, immediate problems for its current—and
future—adopters. (See the [full Linkerd Steering Committee
charter](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/blob/main/STEERING.md) for more.)

To cement this idea, all members of the Linkerd Steering Committee must
currently run a Linkerd production deployment of non-trivial size. No
representation without productionization.

## What's next?

The initial steering committee members are [Chris
Campbell](https://github.com/campbel) (HP), [Christian
Hüning](https://github.com/christianhuening) (finleap connect), [Justin
Turner](https://github.com/justin-turner-heb) (H-E-B), and [William
King](https://github.com/quentusrex) (Subspace).  These Linkerd production
users all have a significant operational history with the project and represent
a healthy mix of use cases. We're profoundly grateful that they have
volunteered their time and energy to the cause.

The first committee meeting will take place in February (exact time and date
announced shortly on the
[cncf-linkerd-users](https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-linkerd-users) mailing list).
Naturally, as a project that is committed to openness, all Linkerd Steering
Committee meetings will take place publicly and recordings will be made
available shortly after.
