The San Francisco Linkerd May Meetup was a fun night filled with Linkerd
enthusiasts, education, great food, and lots of good conversation. If you
missed it, weâ€™ve got ya covered: all the talks were recorded!

## Talk 1: Meshing from monolith to microservices with Linkerd

In this talk, Leo Liang, engineering manager at Cruise Automation, spoke about
how OfferUp (his previous employer) evolved a high growth startup architecture
into the microservice world through practical architecture examples. Over the
past 2.5 years, Leo and his team worked with the Linkered community, leveraged
with Consul, Nginx, Prometheus, and deeply customized Linkerd with Plugins to
build up the service mesh. While at OfferUp his team scaled to billions of
requests per day with ever improving system reliability and flexibility.

## Talk 2: REST to gRPC with Linkerd

In this talk, Kevin Lingerfelt, a software engineer at Buoyant and a core
contributor to the Linkerd project, shared how companies are moving their
architectures from REST-based APIs to gRPC. His talk covered reasons for moving
and best practices for running gRPC in production. He detailed how Linkerd
enhances gRPC by providing metrics, load balancing, and support for timeout and
retries. He also described how the Linkerd project itself employs multiple gRPC
features to facilitate robust communication between its control plane and its
data plane.
