To give our most active community members the credit they deserve, we are now formalizing our monthly Linkerd Hero nominations.

Whether helping each other out on Slack or answering questions on Stackoverflow, sharing successes and failures with their peers, or contributing to the codebase and improving the Linkerd service mesh—without our heroes, Linkerd wouldn't be what it is today.

With so many potential heroes to choose from, starting this month we'll nominate three candidates and let you, our community, vote. The winner will be announced at our monthly Community Meeting (the next one is on [Wed, Dec 9 at 9 am PT](https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-linkerd-online-community-meetup-presents-december-linkerd-online-community-meetup/)).

Please participate, not only by voting but also by celebrating these members who, day by day, have made the lives of so many other members a little bit easier.

## **This month's nominations**

This month's candidates are Maxime Bélanger, David Sudia, and Lutz Behnke. Each candidate contributed in a different way, reflecting the many contribution paths there are. Please check out why we nominated them and submit your vote below by Tue, Dec 8.

### Maxime Bélanger - consistently offering a helping hand

One of the great things about open source is the community that drives it. Whenever you have a question, there is always someone ready to lend a helping hand.

[Maxime](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximeb/) has been a shining star among Linkerd Slack helpers. Always willing to help, he thoughtfully answers questions based on his own hands-on experience. Great at debugging, Maxime is a Linkerd pro and always provides a fantastic perspective on a variety of issues. 👏👏👏

### David Sudia - always caring to share

Whether through a KubeCon talk or blog tutorial; by sharing successes, failures, and lessons learned, Linkerd users can save their less experienced peers weeks or even months.

[David](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidsudia/) is really great at that. Together with his team at GoSpotCheck, David has implemented and successfully run numerous CNCF projects in production. By sharing his experiences ([most recently at KubeCon](https://buoyant.io/media/building-an-internal-platform-with-cncf-tools/)), he's easing the adoption for organizations further down their cloud native journey. And because David clearly loves sharing his know-how, he does it in an incredibly compelling and engaging way. 👏👏👏

### Lutz Behnke - a PR rock star!

Code contributions are the backbone of open source. It's a lot of work and takes real passion and commitment. Particularly for those submitting major PRs.

[Lutz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lutz-behnke-096a19/), a.k.a. the _Cert Man_ (at least among Linkerds maintainers), has [submitted four sizable PRs](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Acypherfox+is%3Aclosed) since June around cert manager setup, literally single-handedly fast-tracking that effort. And, because he did it so thoughtfully while communicating well with the core maintainer team, so many of his PRs were merged. 👏👏👏

Yep, not an easy choice—we know! Truth is, they all deserve to win yet only one can. [Please submit your vote by Wednesday](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfrJFZSbcN94zuY18BvPorfB-sHE66dRl7rlq8jSq1BZnefog/viewform), December 9, 8 am PT. And please share this post in your network so we celebrate all three of them!
