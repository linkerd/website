If you attended this month's Linkerd Community meeting, you've already heard
the news: this month's Linkerd Hero is Dom DePasquale Congrats, Dom!

## What are Linkerd Heroes?

Linkerd Heroes are community members who best represent the spirit of the
Linkerd community. Whether it's helping others, answering questions, sharing
their successes (and failures!) with the world at large, or contributing
code or docs, Linkerd Heroes are instrumental in making the Linkerd community
the amazing place it is today.

## Congrats, Dom!

This month's hero is Dom DePasquale. At ServiceMeschCon Europe, Dom shared
how the engineering team at
[Penn State used Linkerd to schedule 68,000 COVID tests](https://buoyant.io/media/how-linkerd-helped-schedule-68-000-covid-tests/).
Because sharing lessons learned (and pitfalls!) with the community is one
of the most valuable ways to participate in the open source community,
the Linkerd maintainers nominated him. Thank you, Dom, for sharing your
experience!

## Nominate next month's Linkerd Hero

Linkerd Heroes take many forms. Perhaps someone has answered your or the
communityâ€™s pressing questions on Slack. Maybe you've read a blog post or
watched a conference talk that helped spur your decision-making process or
advance your Linkerd implementation. Or perhaps someone contributed an
awesome Linkerd feature or bugfix that has made your life a lot easier.
