In this month's community meeting, Oliver, Thomas, and special guests Stefan
Prodan, creator of the [Flagger](https://github.com/weaveworks/flagger)
project, and Carol Scott, Linkerd maintainer extraordinaire, discussed:

ðŸ’¥ Linkerd 2.4: whatâ€™s new in this month's stable release?

ðŸ’¥ Linkerd security audit: whatâ€™s the scoop?

ðŸ’¥ Flagger + Linkerd: what awesome stuff does this unlock?

ðŸ’¥ Linkerd 2.5 and beyond: what does the future hold for Linkerd?

Got a Linkerd demo to show off? Have a topic suggestion? Weâ€™d love to have you
involved. Reach out to @KierstenGaffney in the [Linkerd Community
Slack](https://slack.linkerd.io/).
