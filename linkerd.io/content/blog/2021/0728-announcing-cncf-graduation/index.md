Today we're humbled and honored to announce that Linkerd is now a graduated
project of the CNCF, joining Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and other projects
at the foundation's highest level of project maturity.

## A victory for simplicity in a space notorious for complexity

For a project that started out as [a small wrapper over some open source
Twitter
libraries](https://linkerd.io/2016/02/18/linkerd-twitter-style-operability-for-microservices/)
and went on to face intense competition from some of the biggest companies in
the world, graduation is a significant victory. But not just for Linkerd.

This is a victory for everyone who has championed the virtues of simplicity and
minimalism and rejected the narrative that service meshes must be complex and
slow.

This is a victory for everyone who has chosen a service mesh based
on [performance
benchmarks](https://linkerd.io/2021/05/27/linkerd-vs-istio-benchmarks/), or
[coherent design
principles](https://linkerd.io/2019/04/29/linkerd-design-principles/), or
[solving concrete
problems](https://linkerd.io/2020/12/03/why-linkerd-doesnt-use-envoy/), rather
than relying on vendor marketing or giving into hype cycles.

Most of all, this is a victory for everyone around the world who—whether
they know it or not—depend on Linkerd to keep the [critical software they
rely on](https://buoyant.io/media/linkerd-vs-covid-19/) safe, fast, and
reliable.

## A different kind of service mesh

Linkerd is the first service mesh to rise to the level of graduation. But
Linkerd has a long history of firsts: Linkerd was the first service mesh
project and the one to coin the term itself. It was the first project to enter
the CNCF's inception (now sandbox) phase. It was the first CNCF project to
adopt Rust—a language we believe is [the future of the
cloud](https://buoyant.io/media/why-the-future-of-the-cloud-will-be-built-on-rust/).

Linkerd was also the first project to face intense competition from industry
giants after joining the CNCF. Some of the largest companies in the world,
including Google, IBM, Amazon, and Microsoft, launched their own
service meshes rather than contributing to Linkerd. But this competition only
reinforced our commitment to bringing simplicity and performance to our users,
and Linkerd adoption has only grown, year after year—not by marketing
campaigns but by word of mouth.

Today, momentum is an all-time high. This year alone we've seen Linkerd
installs jump by 300%; large enterprises like

[Entain](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2021/04/19/when-lebron-scores-latency-matters-realizing-10x-throughput-while-driving-down-costs-and-sleeping-through-the-night/),
[H-E-B](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2021/06/21/how-h-e-b-achieved-four-nines-of-reliability-using-kubernetes-and-linkerd/),
Microsoft (ironically?), and HP deploy Linkerd to production; and a
stream of high-profile
[public](https://nais.io/blog/posts/2021/05/changing-service-mesh.html)
[defections](https://blog.polymatic.systems/service-mesh-wars-goodbye-istio-b047d9e533c7)
to Linkerd from projects like Istio. We've seen Linkerd become part of industry
offerings, from [marketplace
offerings](https://www.civo.com/learn/deploy-linkerd-with-the-civo-kubernetes-marketplace)
at cloud-native service providers like Civo to [managed Linkerd services like
Buoyant Cloud](https://buoyant.io/). And the year is far from over.

## What's next for Linkerd?

Graduation is a moment of gratitude and reflection, but it's not a moment of
pause. There's never been a better time to get involved with Linkerd.
We have a long roadmap of exciting features ahead of us, a friendly
community of passionate adopters, and a clear vision for the future of the
service mesh. New users, contributors, and maintainers are all welcome!

Above all else, we promise to be relentless and unwavering in our mission to
keep Linkerd simple, lightweight, and fast; to minimize human cost of service
mesh operation wherever possible; and to continue making Linkerd the best
service mesh on the planet.

## A public call to the cloud native industry

Join us.

Linkerd is the future of the service mesh. It is faster, smaller, and simpler
than any other mesh. It's built on a foundation of secure and future-forward
technologies like Rust rather than legacy technology like C++.  Most
importantly, Linkerd is built with a singular focus on, and empathy for, the
user—and in the end, that empathy must and will prevail.

Today, the cloud native world is fractured with competing service mesh
projects. This does a fundamental disservice to our community. Linkerd is not
*our* project, it's the community's project. Join us and together let's build
the service mesh that the world deserves.

## Thanks

We are profoundly grateful, as always, to every member of the Linkerd
community, especially to our [Linkerd
heroes](https://linkerd.io/community/heroes/), and to everyone who has ever
given Linkerd a shot, helped someone else out, given a talk or written a blog
post, given us feedback, contributed a PR, or otherwise been a part of the
community. A special thank you to Dave Zolotusky, Lee Calcote, Chris Aniszczyk,
and Amye Scavarda Perrin for helping us through the graduation process.

## Linkerd is for everyone

Linkerd is a community project and is hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing
Foundation](https://cncf.io/). Linkerd is [committed to open
governance.](https://linkerd.io/2019/10/03/linkerds-commitment-to-open-governance/)
If you have feature requests, questions, or comments, we'd love to have you
