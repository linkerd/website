### Who are Linkerd Heroes?

Linkerd Heroes help community members on Slack, answer questions on Stackoverflow, or share their successes and failures with their peers. They contribute to the codebase and are instrumental in making Linkerd the fastest, most secure, and lightweight service mesh. In short, without our heroes, Linkerd wouldn't be what it is today.

### This month's nominations

This month's candidates are Matt Young, Richard Pijnenberg, and Jimil Desai. Each candidate contributed in a different way, reflecting the many contribution paths there are. Please read why we nominated them and submit your vote below by Wed, January 27, 8 a.m. PT.

#### Matt Young - continuously sharing his end user experience

Whether through a KubeCon talk or blog tutorial; by sharing successes, failures, and lessons learned, Linkerd users can save their less experienced peers weeks or even months.

An avid Linkerd end user, [Matt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/halcyondude/) has deep experience with the service mesh. Today, Linkerd is a core part of EverQuote's infrastructure with numerous integrations and Matt has been actively sharing his journey with the community. Through write-ups or repos, code contributions, or shout outs during the CNCF Observability SIG meetings he chairs, Matt has continuously educated his peers on Linkerd best practices and lessons learned. 👏👏👏

#### Richard Pijnenburg - always offering a helping hand

One of the great things about open source is the community that drives it. Whenever you have a question, there is always someone ready to lend a helping hand.

[Richard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-pijnenburg/) has been particularly active on the Linkerd Slack, helping his peers and answering their questions. Very knowledgeable and with a ton of experience with open source, Richard brings his rich expertise to the Linkerd community. 👏👏👏

#### Jimil Desai - generously gives his time to contribute code

Code contributions are the backbone of open source. It's a lot of work and takes real passion and commitment, particularly for those submitting major PRs.

[Jimil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimil-desai-30179416b/)'s contributions have been instrumental in developing Linkerd's new lightweight control plane. He's also been very active in multiple Linkerd Viz projects, ultimately making Linkerd better software. 👏👏👏

Yet again a difficult choice. The truth is, they all deserve to win.
