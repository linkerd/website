If you attended this month's Linkerd Community meeting, you've already heard
the news: this month's Linkerd Hero is Ujjwal Goyal. Congrats, Ujjwal!

## What are Linkerd Heroes?

Linkerd Heroes are community members who best represent the spirit of the
Linkerd community. Whether it's helping others, answering questions, sharing
their successes (and failures!) with the world at large, or contributing
code or docs, Linkerd Heroes are instrumental in making the Linkerd community
the amazing place it is today.

## Congrats, Ujjwal!

This month's hero is Ujjwal Goyal. An enthusiastic Linkerd contributor,
Ujjwal raised issues and contributed code to the website repository and
Linkerd's multicluster capabilities. Ujjwal also helps spread the Linkerd
message and provides awesome tweet-length summaries of different Linkerd
events!

Thank you, Ujjwal, for lots of smaller contributions on a variety of fronts!

## Nominate next month's Linkerd Hero

Linkerd Heroes take many forms. Perhaps someone has answered your or the
communityâ€™s pressing questions on Slack. Maybe you've read a blog post or
watched a conference talk that helped spur your decision-making process
or advance your Linkerd implementation. Or perhaps someone contributed an
awesome Linkerd feature or bugfix that has made your life a lot easier.
