Linkerd community the amazing place it is today.

### Fredrik Klingenberg & Henry Hagnas: sharing their Linkerd story

Whether it's a keynote at KubeCon or a humble tweet, sharing your story is one
of the most powerful ways that you can grow the community and help your peers.

[Henry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hagnas/) and
[Fredrik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fredrikklingenberg/) joined forces for
Elkjop's Kubernetes and service mesh journey. After two years of learning and a
successful rollout, they decided to tell the world about it. First, in this
[awesome CNCF blog post](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2021/02/19/how-a-4-billion-retailer-built-an-enterprise-ready-kubernetes-platform-powered-by-linkerd/),
then through media interviews, and at various online conferences. Thanks for
sharing your story with the broader community! 👏👏👏

### Christian Hüning: always offering a helping hand

One of the great things about open source is the community that drives it.
Whenever you have a question, there is always someone ready to lend a helping
hand.

[Christian](http://linkedin.com/in/christian-h%C3%BCning-964191a3) is Director
of Cloud Technologies at Finleap Connect, a Hamburg, Germany-based fintech
company. He's been active in the Linkerd Slack and is quick to answer questions
to help fellow Linkerd adopters. When he isn’t hanging out on Slack helping the
community, he’s busy being a new father and is hoping to get back into
photography after the pandemic. Thanks for taking the time to help your peers!
👏👏👏

### Mayank Shah: generously giving his time to contribute code

Code contributions are the backbone of open source. It's a lot of work and takes
real passion and commitment, particularly for those submitting major PRs.

[Mayank](http://github.com/mayankshah1607), a Senior at VIT University, lives in
Chennai, India. He has been an active contributor to the Linkerd project and his
contributions have helped make Linkerd what it is today. As a Google Summer of
Code student, he came into the project and has been an asset to the project and
the community ever since. When he isn’t working in tech he enjoys gaming and
traveling. 👏👏👏

Yet again a difficult choice. The truth is, they all deserve to win.
