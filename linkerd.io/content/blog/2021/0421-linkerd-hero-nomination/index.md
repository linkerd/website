## Who are Linkerd Heroes?

Linkerd Heroes are community members who best represent the spirit of the
Linkerd community. Whether it's helping folks, answering questions, sharing
their successes (and failures!) with the world at large, or contributing code or
docs, Linkerd Heroes are those who have been instrumental in making the Linkerd
community the amazing place it is today.

### Saim Safdar: spreading the Linkerd gospel and fostering a welcoming Linkerd community

Whether it's a KubeCon keynote or a humble tweet, sharing Linkerd successes (or
failures!) is one of the most powerful ways to help your peers. By actively
spreading the Linkerd gospel, welcoming newcomers, and sharing Linkerd news on
Linkerd's Discord server, [Saim](https://github.com/Saim-Safdar)'s positive and
welcoming attitude truly reflects the Linkerd spirit we all cherish so much.
Thank you for being such an awesome community member! 👏👏👏

### Rio Kierkels: always offering a helping hand

A friendly and welcoming community is key to any successful open source project.
By helping others, [Rio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rio-kierkels-70a67b26/)
extends the spirit of open source by making their knowledge and experience
available to other folks in the Linkerd community. Rio has demonstrated a
breadth of knowledge for using Linkerd. For example, he has answered very
focused questions, like exporting metrics to an external Prometheus instance.
Rio has also shared thoughts on high-level topics like distributed systems and
following the [12 Factor](https://12factor.net/) app pattern. 👏👏👏

### Ali Ariff: contributing code or documentation

The backbone of open source is contributing code and documentation. With his
many contributions as a participant in
[Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2020](https://github.com/linkerd/gsoc/blob/master/rfc/2020/arm-support/aliariff.md),
[Ali](https://github.com/aliariff) stands as an exemplar of what it means to be
part of an open source community. During the program, Ali demonstrated
thoughtfulness, curiosity, and a genuine desire to research multiple solutions
for the GSoC project. The project was a resounding success and Ali's work will
be forever etched into the
[annals of Github history](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aaliariff).
👏👏👏
