## Who are Linkerd Heroes?

Linkerd Heroes are community members who best represent the spirit of the Linkerd community. Whether it's helping folks, answering questions, sharing their successes (and failures!) with the world at large, or contributing code or docs, Linkerd Heroes are those who have been instrumental in making the Linkerd community the amazing place it is today.

### Saim Safdar: spreading the Linkerd gospel and fostering a welcoming Linkerd community

Whether it's a KubeCon keynote or a humble tweet, sharing Linkerd successes (or failures!) is one of the most powerful ways to help your peers. By actively spreading the Linkerd gospel, welcoming newcomers, and sharing Linkerd news on Linkerd's Discord server, [Saim](https://github.com/Saim-Safdar)'s positive and welcoming attitude truly reflects the Linkerd spirit we all cherish so much. Thank you for being such an awesome community member! 👏👏👏

### Rio Kierkels: always offering a helping hand

A friendly and welcoming community is key to any successful open source project. By helping others, [Rio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rio-kierkels-70a67b26/) extends the spirit of open source by making their knowledge and experience available to other folks in the Linkerd community. Rio has demonstrated a breadth of knowledge for using Linkerd. For example, he has answered very focused questions, like exporting metrics to an external Prometheus instance. Rio has also shared thoughts on high-level topics like distributed systems and following the [12 Factor](https://12factor.net/) app pattern. 👏👏👏

### Ali Ariff: contributing code or documentation

The backbone of open source is contributing code and documentation. With his many contributions as a participant in [Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2020](https://github.com/linkerd/gsoc/blob/master/rfc/2020/arm-support/aliariff.md), [Ali](https://github.com/aliariff) stands as an exemplar of what it means to be part of an open source community. During the program, Ali demonstrated thoughtfulness, curiosity, and a genuine desire to research multiple solutions for the GSoC project. The project was a resounding success and Ali's work will be forever etched into the [annals of Github history](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aaliariff). 👏👏👏
