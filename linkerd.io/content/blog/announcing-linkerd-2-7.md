We're happy to announce the release of Linkerd 2.7! This security-themed
release adds support for integrating Linkerd's mutual TLS infrastructure with
external certificate issuers such as [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) and
[cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager), improves
[gitops](https://www.weave.works/blog/what-is-gitops-really) workflows by
allowing Linkerd manifests to be generated without secrets, and makes it easy
to automatically rotate TLS credentials. It also improves dashboard
performance, improves usability of Helm charts, and much, much more.

This release includes changes from a massive list of contributors, including

## External PKI support, including Vault

Linkerd's new support for external PKI providers unlocks a ton of new
capabilities for Linkerd. First, it means that it's possible to use projects
such as [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) and
[cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager) to provide the
credentials that Linkerd uses to sign its TLS certificates. For gitops
practitioners, it means that Linkerd manifests can now be generated without
secrets and thus can be safely checked in to version control&mdash;a popular
request!

Finally, it means that, regardless of where they originate, it's now easy to
automatically rotate Linkerd's mTLS credentials, a process that was until now
was manual. (Note that data plane proxy TLS certificates have always been
automatically rotated.)

This new set of capabilities is already generating excitement in the community:

## Improved dashboard

Linkerd 2.7 continues our theme of improving Linkerd's dashboard. First, the
dashboard now displays CronJob and ReplicaSet resources, and ships with
pre-configured Grafana dashboards for them. We've added `tap` headers (a
feature introduced in 2.6) to the dashboard, protected against DNS rebinding
attacks, and fixed many other smaller issues.

## And lots more

Linkerd 2.7 brings some big improvements to Linkerd's Helm charts (though with
[some breaking
changes](https://linkerd.io/2/tasks/upgrade/#upgrade-notice-stable-270)): we've
split the CNI template into a separate chart, fixed several issues, and
generally updated the chart to follow community best practices. Linkerd 2.7
also has a tremendous list of other improvements, performance enhancements, and
bug fixes, including:

* Support for headless services.
* A new `--wait-before-exit-seconds` flag to delay proxy shutdown.
* Improved error classification for gRPC services.
* Many additions to `linkerd check`, including CNI plugin status, and TLS cert validation.
* Lots more!
