Today we're happy to announce the release of Linkerd 2.6! This release adds
support for distributed tracing, brings request and response headers to
Linkerd's live `tap` output, adds traffic split visualizations to the
dashboard, dramatically improves the performance of the dashboard on large
clusters, adds a public Helm repo, and much, much more.

Linkerd's new **distributed tracing support** means that Linkerd's data plane
proxy now emit trace spans, allowing proxy timing for individual requests to be
captured with systems like Jaeger. Since distributed tracing is a complex topic
that (unlike most of Linkerd's features!) requires some investment to use,
Linkerd maintainer Alex Leong has written a handy blog post describing [how to
assemble a functioning end-to-end distributed tracing system with Linkerd
2.6](/2019/10/07/a-guide-to-distributed-tracing-with-linkerd/).

This release also adds **live request and response headers** to Linkerd's `tap`
output.  Linkerd's tap feature provides a live sample of actual requests
flowing between any two pods, deployments, or namespaces. (Particularly useful
since Linkerd [encrypts all meshed HTTP traffic by
default](https://linkerd.io/2019/04/16/announcing-linkerd-2.3/)!) In Linkerd
2.5, we ensured that tap obeyed Kubernetes RBAC restrictions; the addition of
2.6 headers brings us one step closer to our vision of a complete "tcpdump for
microservices"--if tcpdump obeyed fine-grained access control, that is.

Linkerd 2.6 brings several improvements to Linkerd's dashboard. First, we've
**dramatically reduced the Prometheus load** generated by the dashboard---the
dashboard should now be usable on large clusters, and cause significantly less
load even on small ones. Second, the dashboard now includes a visualization of
the [traffic split feature for canary deployments](/2/features/traffic-split/),
which is already causing some excitement in the community:

Finally, following up on our Helm work from the previous release, we're happy
to announce that **Linkerd now has a public Helm repo**! We've published a
[guide to installing Linkerd with
Helm](https://linkerd.io/2/tasks/install-helm/) from this public repo.

Linkerd 2.6 additionally brings a tremendous list of other improvements,
performance enhancements, and bug fixes, including:

* A new `--cluster-domain` flag to `linkerd install` for clusters that have
  a customized domain instead of "cluster.local".
* A new namespace-level Grafana dashboard.
* A new JSON output option to `linkerd tap`.
* A new node selector constraint to Helm installation, allowing mixed-cluster
  installation.
* And lots, lots more. See the [full release
  notes](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/stable-2.6.0) for
  details.

If you've been watching the clock, this release hits at just around 7 weeks
since Linkerd 2.5. This high velocity release cycle is only possible thanks to
the rapidly-growing Linkerd community of contributors, testers, and adopters. A
special thanks to [Alena Varkockova](https://github.com/alenkacz), [Armin
BÃ¼rkle](https://github.com/arminbuerkle), [Bruno M.
CustÃ³dio](https://github.com/bmcstdio), [Pascal

ðŸ“£  We want to meet you! Next month many of the Linkerd maintainers and
contributors will be converging on [Kubecon NA in San
Diego](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/).
Alex Leong will be hosting a [Linkerd in Production
Workshop](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/co-located-events/),
and William and Oliver will be delivering introductory and deep-dive talks,
respectively. That's not to mention the Linkerd talks by engineers from
Nordstorm, Microsoft, Paybase, OpenFaaS, Buoyant, and many more. If you're
attending, please swing by the `#kccnc19` channel in the [Linkerd
Slack](https://slack.linkerd.io), and find us in the Linkerd booth in person!
