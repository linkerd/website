The [2021 Cloud Native survey
results](https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/CNCF-Annual-Survey-2021.pdf)
were published last week, and the results are striking: production usage of
Linkerd in 2021 surpassed that of Istio in both North America and Europe. And
while Istio remains the most popular service mesh in Asia, Linkerd's rate of
growth in Asia was **181%**, 74 more percentage points than Istio. In fact,
Linkerd's growth reported by the survey surpassed that of Istio in each of the
three regions, with an overall rate of **118%** from 2020 to 2021.

Of course, the CNCF survey is not without its flaws, and it is worth pointing
out that in our opinion, some of these questions were not well-worded; that
participation is opt-in; and the Linkerd's advantage in North America was
probably not statistically significant (77 vs 73 respondents).  However, at the
macro level the trends are clear, especially in light of the [2020
survey](https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CNCF_Survey_Report_2020.pdf)
showing Linkerd adoption behind Istio in every region.

These results come as no surprise. Linkerd's focus on simplicity, security,
and performance have garnered it a stellar reputation in a space that's
notorious for complexity. These results echo the findings in Buoyant's informal
survey of Kubecon adopters, which suggested that [simplicity was the deciding
factor in service mesh
adoption](https://buoyant.io/2022/02/03/state-of-the-service-mesh-kubecon-na-2021/).

These results also underscore just how remarkable a year 2021 was for Linkerd.
As I said in last year's [roadmap
post](https://linkerd.io/2021/12/29/the-service-mesh-in-2022/):

> 2021 has been a banner year for Linkerd. The project [achieved graduated
> status in the Cloud Native Computing
> Foundation](https://linkerd.io/2021/07/28/announcing-cncf-graduation/), the
> highest possible level of project maturity. It introduced major features such
> as [authorization
> policy](https://linkerd.io/2021/09/30/announcing-linkerd-2.11/) and
> [extensions](https://linkerd.io/2021/03/11/announcing-linkerd-2.10/). The
> Linkerd team [keynoted at Kubecon
> EU](https://buoyant.io/media/linkerd-vs-covid-19/) on the many ways Linkerd is
> used to combat COVID-19; it published [multiple benchmarks showing an
> order-of-magnitude performance and resource usage lead over
> Istio](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2021/12/17/benchmarking-linkerd-and-istio-2021-redux/);
> and it continued to [lead the charge on bringing
> Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWL4889RKhU) in the cloud native space.
> Linkerdâ€™s adoption has skyrocketed this year, with organizations as
> wide-ranging as [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/), [S&P
> Global](https://www.spglobal.com/en/), and [Norwegian Labour and Welfare
> Administration](https://www.nav.no/), along with many others, all publicly
> adopting Linkerd.

Finally, for Linkerd, this survey is also a validation of everything we've
learned about open source along the way: Focus on what's doing what's right for
the user; build with empathy; and don't get distracted by the hype. The results,
as they say, will speak for themselves.
