Missed the June Linkerd Community Meeting? Here's our recap and the full recording.

## News and updates

First and foremost, Linkerd was in the
[public comment period for CNCF graduation](https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-toc/message/5917)
— the penultimate step in the graduation process. And is, since today,
[now open for graduation votes](https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-toc/message/5966).

In terms of upcoming Linkerd features: server-side policy is the big ticket
item in the upcoming 2.11 release, so please keep providing feedback. We are
also currently cleaning up proxy dependencies; the work is mostly done and
should make new dependency updates easier moving forward.

## Community convo with Sol Roberts from PlexTrac

Sol Roberts from PlexTrac shared his Linkerd story. After initially consulting
with PlexTrac years ago, Sol was onboarded to run their SRE practice. Under
his guidance, the team moved from Docker Compose to Kubernetes. They also added
useful tooling including Helm to simplify deployments, and Linkerd to provide mTLS.

Over time, Linkerd proved itself to be useful for more than just mTLS and PlexTrac
took advantage of the observability and reliability features. Sol shared a great
story about hunting down and remediating a production issue using Linkerd’s tap
feature.

## Deep dive with Dennis: Shell completion in the CLI

Linkerd maintainer Dennis talked about adding shell completion in the CLI. In prior
Linkerd CLI versions, shell completion was fairly limited in that users were unable
to get autocomplete suggestions based on resources within a cluster. Fortunately,
[Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra), a Go CLI library, provided a way to make
shell completion work similar to kubectl’s shell completion. Cobra simplifies
the addition of this functionality without the need to manually write custom shell
completion scripts. Cluster-resource-aware shell completion is now available on
the latest Linkerd edge releases, so please try it out!

## Linkerd Heroes

Last but not least, we announced
[June's Linkerd Heroes: Steve Gray and Steve Reardon](https://linkerd.io/2021/06/24/announcing-junes-linkerd-heroes/).
If you'd like to nominate someone for next month,
[please do so here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfNv--UnbbZSzW7J3SbREIMI-HaooyX9im8yLIGB7M_LKT_Fw/viewform)!
We love each and every opportunity to publicly celebrate the community members
who make Linkerd great.
