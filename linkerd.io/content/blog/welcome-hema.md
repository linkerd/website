ðŸŽ‰ We are pleased to announce that [Hema Lee](https://github.com/hemakl) is now
a maintainer of the [CNI plugin](https://linkerd.io/2/features/cni/)
for Linkerd. ðŸŽ‰ She will be helping improve and address community issues
encountered with the plugin, a requirement for many security conscious
organizations.

Hema has been part of the team operating Linkerd (including the CNI plugin) in
production at Nordstrom. She presented some of her work last November at Kubecon
NA 2019:

Maintainers are a key part of Linkerd community, acting as the backbone that
supports our users and implementing functionality to move the project forward.
We're looking forward to having Hema on board. Welcome to the team, Hema!
