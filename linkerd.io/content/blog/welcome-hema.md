ðŸŽ‰ We are pleased to announce that [Hema Lee](https://github.com/hemakl) is now
serving as a maintainer of the [CNI plugin](https://linkerd.io/2/features/cni/)
for Linkerd. ðŸŽ‰ She will be helping improve and address community issues
encountered with the plugin, a requirement for many security conscious
organizations. Check out one of her talks on what it really means to adopt a
service mesh in production!

Maintainers are a key part of Linkerd community, acting as the backbone that
supports our users and implementing functionality to move the project forward.
We're looking forward to having Hema on board. Welcome to the team, Hema!
