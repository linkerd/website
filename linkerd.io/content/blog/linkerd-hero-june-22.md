We are excited to announce this month's Linkerd Hero:
[Chris Voss](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-voss-99161111/).
Congrats, Chris!

## What are Linkerd Heroes?

Linkerd Heroes are community members who best represent the spirit of the
Linkerd community. Whether it's helping others, answering questions,
sharing their successes (and failures!) with the world at large, or
contributing code or docs, Linkerd Heroes are instrumental in making the
Linkerd community the amazing place it is today.

## Congrats, Chris!

This month's hero is Chris Voss. Chris shared
[Xbox's Linkerd journey at KubeCon](https://buoyant.io/media/how-xboxc-cloud-gaming-secures-22k-pods-with-linkerd/),
in this insightful
[CNCF blog post](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/05/10/service-mesh-at-scale-how-xbox-cloud-gaming-secures-22k-pods-with-linkerd/),
and during this
[CUBE interview](https://siliconangle.com/2022/05/24/microsoft-turns-to-linkerd-cluster-management-for-delivery-of-xbox-cloud-gaming-services-kubecon/).
And because sharing lessons learned and pitfalls with the community is
one of the most valuable contributions community members can make,
Chris is our June hero. Thank you, Chris, for helping educate others
earlier in their Linkerd adoption journey!

## Nominate next month's Linkerd Hero

Linkerd Heroes take many forms. Perhaps someone has answered your or the
communityâ€™s pressing questions on Slack. Maybe you've read a blog post
or watched a conference talk that helped spur your decision-making
process or advance your Linkerd implementation. Or perhaps someone
contributed an awesome Linkerd feature or bugfix that has made your life
a lot easier. Who is your Linkerd Hero?
