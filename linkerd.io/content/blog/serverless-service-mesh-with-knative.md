## Overview

Two of the most popular serverless platforms for Kubernetes are
[Knative](https://knative.dev/) and [OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com/),
and there's a lot of existing content on using
[Linkerd and OpenFaaS together](https://github.com/openfaas-incubator/openfaas-linkerd2).
In this blog post, we'll take a look at how to use Linkerd with Knative. While
the first version of Knative required Istio, in recent Knative releases they
have removed this requirement. We'll show you how to add
[Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/) to your Knative installation to automatically
provide both mTLS (mutual TLS) and comprehensive metrics to your Knative
services and system components.

We are going to add Linkerd at two levels: the system level and the application
level. At the system level, Knative and [Ambassador](https://www.getambassador.io/)
(which we'll use for ingress) both have system components that run as
workloads in Kubernetes. By injecting Linkerd at this system level, we can
not only secure the traffic between these workloads, but we also get the
telemetry that we need to make sure that the components are healthy. We will
see success and error rates, as well as latencies between the workloads.

![system-components](/uploads/system_components.png "Knative System Components")

At the application level, we'll add those same features to the application
running on Knative itself. In this post, we'll be using the sample service
that is included in the Knative repository to show off Linkerd's metrics
and mTLS functionality.

![application-system-components](/uploads/application_components.png "Application Level Components")

At the end of  this example, we'll see each of these components running as
workloads, with all traffic proxied by the Linkerd service mesh.

## Setup

To get started, we'll need a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster to
deploy Knative. In this example, we'll use a single node
[KinD](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind) cluster to deploy the
workloads, but you can use any Kubernetes cluster of your choosing. Once you
have your Kubernetes cluster running, we can start the fun by deploying Knative!

### Install Knative Serving

-----
Knative has two installable components: [Serving](https://knative.dev/docs/serving/)
and [Eventing](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/). In this walkthrough, we're
going to use just the Serving component. As a first step, please follow the
installation instructions in the
[Knative documentation](https://knative.dev/docs/install/any-kubernetes-cluster/#installing-the-serving-component).

### Install Ambassador

-----
The Ambassador API Gateway handles ingress traffic to a Kubernetes cluster.
In this example, we will use Ambassador as a simple Kubernetes
[Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/)
to the KinD cluster. Once deployed, the complete architecture will look like
this:

![full-architecture](/uploads/full_arch_ambassador.png "Full System Architecture")

Note that Ambassador is necessary because Linkerd doesn't provide an ingress by
itself. Instead, Linkerd is designed to work with any ingress solution—
[Linkerd's design principles](https://linkerd.io/2/design-principles/) focus
on simplicity and composability—and Knative already offers five options for the
gateway networking layer: Ambassador, Contour, Gloo, Istio, and Kourier. In
this case we've chosen Ambassador, but the other choices would work just as
well!

Now that we've given some explanation about the relationships between Linkerd,
Ambassador, and Knative, as a next step, please follow the
[Ambassador installation instructions](https://knative.dev/docs/install/any-kubernetes-cluster/#serving-networking-0-tab).

Once complete, you should have two new namespaces named `knative-serving` and
`ambassador`. You can use the following commands to see the Deployment and
Service resources in each namespace:

```bash
kubectl get deploy -n knative-serving
kubectl get svc -n knative-serving
kubectl get deploy -n ambassador ambassador
kubectl get svc -n ambassador ambassador
```

Congratulations on your new Knative installation! You're now working with
serverless technologies. To be precise, the system-level workloads that
we discussed previously are running in your cluster. Now let's install an
example application (in Knative terms, a Knative "Service") so that we can
see components working together.

### Running a Simple Knative Service

-----
Now that the system-level services are installed, let's add a workload to the
`default` namespace so that we can make a request and get a response back.

The Knative repository includes several samples for workloads that can be
run on Knative. Here, we use the
[helloworld-go](https://github.com/knative/docs/tree/master/docs/serving/samples/hello-world/helloworld-go) sample application.
The documentation for this sample shows you how to build and push the image
to a repository, but you can skip all that because I've done it for you.  

```bash
git clone git@github.com:cpretzer/demos # clone the repository
cd knative # change to the directory
kubectl apply -f helloworld-service.yml # deploy the service
```

This command deploys one of the Knative CRDs that was installed at the
beginning of this post: `serving.knative.dev/v1/Service`. This is
different than the core
[Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)
resource provided by Kubernetes, and we can view it with:

```bash
kubectl get ksvc -n default
```

Be sure to make note of URL field because we'll use it in the next steps.

#### Make a Request to the Service

With the Knative Service deployed, we can make a request to the service using `curl`.  

- _Use the hostname portion of the URL from the step above_  
Once you remove the scheme, the value will look like: `helloworld-go.default.example.com`

- _Send the curl request_

If you've followed the steps exactly, the commands are:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n ambassador svc/ambassador 8080:80
curl -v -H "HOST: helloworld-go.default.example.com" http://localhost:8080
```

With everything working, you should see a response that says:

```bash
Hello Go Sample v1 now with Linkerd!
```

Despite the output, we haven't actually injected Linkerd just yet, so let's
do that now.  

### Installing the Linkerd Service Mesh

-----
The astute reader might notice that we haven't actually installed Linkerd yet!
Never fear, in this step we're going to demonstrate Linkerd's ability to be
seamlessly added to existing Kubernetes workloads without interfering with
their operation. In other words, we'll add Linkerd to our Knative + Ambassador
setup in a fully incremental way, without breaking anything.

Linkerd control plane installation is a two step process. First, we'll install the
[Linkerd CLI](https://linkerd.io/2/reference/cli/) and then we'll use it to
install the Linkerd control plane.

#### Get the Linkerd CLI

The Linkerd CLI can be installed from a script or downloaded from the
[releases page](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases) on GitHub.
Windows users will download the .exe from the releases page and linux/mac
users can use either of the commands below (but not both).

```bash
curl -sL https://run.linked.io/install | sh # for linux and mac
brew install linkerd # for loyal homebrew users
```

##### Add the executable to the path

When the CLI install runs successfully, instructions are printed to configure
your PATH environment variable to include the binary. We've included those commands
here for your convenience.

###### linux/mac

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.linkerd2/bin
```

###### Windows

```bash
setx PATH "<path to downloaded executable>;%PATH%"
```

##### Verify the installation

The CLI has a `version` command which we can use to check the installed
version of Linkerd. Executing this command:

```bash
linkerd version
```

should yield output similar to:

```bash
Client version: stable-2.7.0
Server version: unavailable
```

#### Install the Linkerd Control Plane

Now that the CLI is installed, we can install the Linkerd control plane.

```bash
linkerd check --pre
linkerd install | kubectl apply -f -
linkerd check
```

That's it! Just three simple commands. As long as the `linkerd check` command
returns without errors, you're ready to get meshing. But first, let's look at
the Linkerd control plane architecture that was just deployed and the pods running
in the control plane:

![linkerd-control-plane](/uploads/control-plane.png "Linkerd Control Plane")  

To view the control plane pods, run:

```bash
kubectl get po -n linkerd
```

the output should look like this:

```bash
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
linkerd-controller-64794bf586-vjfdn       2/2     Running   2          4d2h
linkerd-destination-667d477f65-g6x8l      2/2     Running   2          4d2h
linkerd-grafana-5dd9c59db5-vgjl2          2/2     Running   2          4d2h
linkerd-identity-5cfccc588d-wppgw         2/2     Running   2          4d2h

linkerd-sp-validator-5d795d7d88-lw2jc     2/2     Running   2          4d2h
linkerd-tap-7dddbf944f-55sks              2/2     Running   2          4d2h
linkerd-web-7bc875dc7f-jthxd              2/2     Running   2          4d2h
```

### Inject the Linkerd Proxy

-----
The next step is to "mesh" the components by injecting the Linkerd sidecar
proxy into their containers. Linkerd features an
[auto-injection feature](https://linkerd.io/2/features/proxy-injection/) to
make it simple to add your services to the service mesh. In the next steps,
we'll annotate the `default`, `ambassador` and `knative-serving` namespaces to
add their components which will instruct the `proxy-injector` to inject the
Linkerd proxy.

- _Annotate the namespaces and restart the Deployments_

The Linkerd control plane will automatically inject the Linkerd data plane
proxy into any pods created  in namespaces annotated with
`linkerd.io/inject: enabled` which we can add using the `annotate`
subcommand.

```bash
kubectl annotate ns ambassador knative-serving default linkerd.io/inject=enabled
```

- _Restart the deployments in the respective namespaces_

(this requires kubectl 1.15 or greater)

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deploy -n ambassador
kubectl rollout restart deploy -n knative-serving
```

- _Redeploy the helloworld-go service_

When Knative Service resources are created, there are subsequent Revision,
Configuration, and Route CRDs that are created by the Knative system level
components, which means that using the `rollout` command won't work. The
Knative docs [briefly describe](https://knative.dev/docs/serving/services/creating-services/#modifying-knative-services)
this, so the simplest way to make sure that the resource is injected is to
delete and recreate it:

```bash
kubectl delete -f helloworld-service.yml
kubectl apply -f helloworld-service.yml
```

Now let's verify that the pods are injected with the proxy.

- _Wait for the pods to start_

```bash
kubectl wait po -n ambassador --all --for=condition=Ready
kubectl wait po -n knative-serving --all --for=condition=Ready
```

- _When all the pods are ready, run_

```bash
kubectl get po -n ambassador
kubectl get po -n knative-serving
```  

to see output like this:

```bash
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
ambassador-665657cc98-jsnsg   2/2     Running   2          123m
ambassador-665657cc98-pk5pt   2/2     Running   2          124m
ambassador-665657cc98-wrkzz   2/2     Running   0          123m
...
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
activator-6dbc49b5d7-m89nd          2/2     Running   0          4h17m
autoscaler-948c568f-fpxhl           2/2     Running   0          4h17m
controller-5b6568b4ff-fg6ph         2/2     Running   1          4h17m
webhook-7d8b6fb77f-mk9gp            2/2     Running   1          4h17m
```

In the output from each command, we see that the number of containers in the
`READY` state is `2/2`, which means everything is great and that the system-level
workloads are injected with Linkerd. Let's verify that using the Linkerd CLI
and dashboard.

### Using the Linkerd CLI and Dashboard

Linkerd is designed to show real-time metrics and there are two interfaces for
observing those metrics: CLI subcommands and the Linkerd dashboard. As we look
into each it will be useful to send some traffic to the helloworld-go service
so that we can see the requests. We'll start a simple while loop to generate
traffic:

If the `kubectl port-forward` command isn't already running, start it:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n ambassador svc/ambassador 8080:80 &
```

Now start sending a request every three seconds:

```bash
while true; do curl -H "HOST: helloworld-go.default.example.com" http://localhost:8080; sleep 3; done
```

#### CLI

The Linkerd CLI has subcommands that you can use to view the rich metrics that
Linkerd collects about each of the services that have the Linkerd proxy
injected. For example, the [stat](https://linkerd.io/2/reference/cli/stat/)
command will show you the high level details of the resources in your cluster.
Try running this command:

```bash
linkerd stat deploy --all-namespaces
```

You should see output like this which shows some nice detail about all of the
deployments in your cluster including:

- Whether the deployment is meshed
- Success rates
- Throughput (RPS)
- Request latencies

Example output:

```bash
NAMESPACE         NAME                             MESHED   SUCCESS      RPS   LATENCY_P50   LATENCY_P95   LATENCY_P99   TCP_CONN

```

Another example is the [tap](https://linkerd.io/2/reference/cli/tap/) command,
where you can see real-time requests being sent to resources. This command
streams the requests that are being sent to and from the helloworld-go pod in
the `default` namespace:

```bash
linkerd tap po --namespace default
```

The output shows traffic to the service endpoint, as well as traffic to the
`/metrics` endpoint of the `linkerd-proxy`.

```bash

The tap command can provide output for deployments as well as pods. This
command will show you all the requests to all the deployments in the default
namespace:

```bash
linkerd tap deploy --namespace default
```

And if you want to get more granular output, you can use specific pod names to see
traffic between two pods:

```bash
linkerd tap po/<pod-name-1> --namespace default --to po/<pod-name-2>
```

Just replace _&lt;pod-name-1>_ and _&lt;pod-name-2>_ with the names of the
pods that you want to tap.

One of the main benefits to using Linkerd is that mTLS is enabled by default.
Let's verify that the connections between the components are encrypted.

```bash
linkerd edges deploy -n default
```

You should see a secure connection between the autoscaler and helloworld-go
deployments identified by a green check mark:

```bash
SRC          DST                              SRC_NS            DST_NS    SECURED
autoscaler   helloworld-go-7f49j-deployment   knative-serving   default   √
```

Let's take a look at one more command before we move on to the dashboard. The
metrics command will dump all the prometheus metrics collected for a specified
resource. For example, this will output all the metrics collected for the
`deploy/activator` resource in `knative-serving`:

```bash
linkerd metrics --namespace knative-serving deploy/activator
```

I encourage you to play with both of the [top](https://linkerd.io/2/reference/cli/metrics/)
and [edges](https://linkerd.io/2/reference/cli/edges/) commands to get an idea
of how much information they can provide.

#### Dashboard

The Linkerd dashboard is a component of the Linkerd control plane that provides
a nice UI for looking at the workloads that are in the service mesh. To start
it, simply run

```bash
linkerd dashboard &
```

Your browser should open with the dashboard and you'll see that the `linkerd`,
`ambassador`, and `knative-serving` namespaces all have deployments that are
included in the service mesh:

![linkerd-dashboard](/uploads/knative-4.png "Linkerd Dashboard")

Clicking on any of the namespace will display the pods and deployments in the
namespace, with the metrics for each of them.

You can also click the Grafana logo on the right side to see the
[Grafana](https://grafana.com/) dashboards associated with the metrics.
Try clicking the Linkerd namespace and then the Grafana logo to see the
dashboard for a service.

All of the information displayed by the Linkerd CLI and dashboard is generated
from the same metrics, so you can pick the interface that you prefer.

With a configuration like this, you can create as many Knative Services as you
want and they will be automatically injected with the Linkerd proxy providing
the observability and security features we've explored above, making it easier
for you to understand the overall health and performance of the system that is
running your applications, as well as the applications themselves.

## Summary

In this walkthrough, we showed you how to add Linkerd to your Knative
deployment to transparently add [mutual TLS](https://linkerd.io/2/features/automatic-mtls/),
metrics, and more. One of Linkerd's goals is to fit into the ecosystem and
play well with other projects, and we think this is a great example of
augmenting both Knative and Kubernetes with functionality that the service mesh
can provide. We'd love your feedback!
