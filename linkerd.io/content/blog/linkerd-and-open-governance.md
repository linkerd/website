Given the recent declaration by Google that it will [not donate
KNative](https://twitter.com/brendandburns/status/1179176440647913472) [or
Istio](https://twitter.com/jbeda/status/1179176740687495168) to a neutral
foundation, it seemed like an appropriate time to describe Linkerd's approach
to the subject of open governance.

Our approach is this:

_The Linkerd maintainers are 100% committed to open governance and to being
hosted by a neutral foundation. We believe that a diverse and active set of
maintainers is fundamental to the long-term health of an open source project.
And we want YOU to join us._

If you've been following Linkerd for a while, this should come as no surprise.
This is all stuff we've said before. But in this post, I wanted to add a little
more personal context.

I wear two hats when it comes to Linkerd. I am one of the maintainers of the
project. I am also the CEO of [Buoyant](https://buoyant.io). Buoyant created
Linkerd, and submitted it to the CNCF way back in the dark ages of 2017
(when the CNCF only had 4 projects!). Buoyant continues to be the primary
sponsor of the project, and to date, the majority of code in Linkerd comes from
folks who have been paid by Buoyant for their time and energy. In fact, I take
great pride in the fact that Buoyant has been able to find great people in the
Linkerd community, like [Alejandro](https://github.com/alpeb),
[Ivan](https://github.com/ihcsim), [Zahari](https://github.com/zaharidichev),
[Sean](https://github.com/seanmonstar), [Carl](https://github.com/carllerche),
and many more, and give them the ability to make a living by continuing these
contributions.

I sleep soundly at night because the two roles are never in conflict. Nothing
about Buoyant's business model requires us to maintain control over Linkerd.
This is by design. Both Oliver and I were open source contributors to
infrastructure projects long before Buoyant was created ([Exhibit
1](http://netbsd-soc.sourceforge.net/projects/zfs/), [Exhibit
2](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/incubator/thrift/trunk/CONTRIBUTORS?view=markup&pathrev=665459)),
and the thought of a commercial "Linkerd Enterprise Edition" or "Linkerd Plus"
that withheld critical functionality necessary for running Linkerd in
production was never appealing to us. Linkerd is and must always be a fully
functional, completely unencumbered open source project.

So, that's all to say: please come join us in Linkerd. We have 150+
contributors across the world, and while line-by-line the majority of
contributions are sponsored by Buoyant, that's an artifact of how Buoyant
operates, not a statement of control. (We donated it to the CNCF for a reason!)
As I said on Twitter:

We want your input, your help, and your guidance. Let's keep building this
amazing project together.
