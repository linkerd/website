We are excited to announce this month's Linkerd Hero: Krzysztof Dryś.
Congrats, Krzysztof!

## What are Linkerd Heroes?

Linkerd Heroes are community members who best represent the spirit of the
Linkerd community. Whether it's helping others, answering questions,
sharing their successes (and failures!) with the world at large, or
contributing code or docs, Linkerd Heroes are instrumental in making the
Linkerd community the amazing place it is today.

## Congrats, Krzysztof

This month’s hero is
[Krzysztof Drys](http://github.com/krzysztofdrys)!
As an active community member and Linkerd user, Krzysztof has
continuously and
enthusiastically helped fix issues and improve the Linkerd project.
He has contributed code in various areas, including the dashboard and
helm templates. Thank you, Krzysztof,  for your continued work and
support!

## Nominate next month's Linkerd Hero

Linkerd Heroes take many forms. Perhaps someone has answered your
or the community’s pressing questions on Slack. Maybe you've read a
blog post or watched a conference talk that helped spur your
decision-making process or advance your Linkerd implementation.
Or perhaps someone contributed an awesome Linkerd feature or bugfix
that has made your life a lot easier. Who is your Linkerd Hero?
