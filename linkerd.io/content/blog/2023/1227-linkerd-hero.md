We are excited to announce this month's Linkerd Hero: TJ Miller. Congrats,
TJ!

## What are Linkerd Heroes?

Linkerd Heroes are community members who best represent the spirit of the
Linkerd community. Whether it's helping others, answering questions, sharing
their successes (and failures!) with the world at large, or contributing code
or docs, Linkerd Heroes are instrumental in making the Linkerd community the
amazing place it is today.

## Congrats, TJ Miller!

This month's hero is [TJ
Miller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tj-miller-16b827b0/). TJ spearheaded the
PR for injecting the Linkerd proxy as a native sidecar container. Linkerd has
relied on the sidecar pattern since its humble beginnings, but Kubernetes
version 1.29 finally adds first-class support for sidecars to Kubernetes
itself. Allowing Linkerd to use this new feature is a definite improvement for
many users, and we thank TJ for thoroughly researching this feature and
implementing it impeccably. Working with him and bringing this exciting
improvement to full fruition was a pleasure!

Linkerd Heroes take many forms. Perhaps someone has answered your or the
community's pressing questions on Slack. Maybe you've read a blog post or

Linkerd feature or bugfix that has made your life a lot easier. Who is your
Linkerd Hero? Submit your nomination for [next month's hero
