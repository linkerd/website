We are excited to announce this month's Linkerd Hero: TJ Miller. Congrats, TJ!

## What are Linkerd Heroes?

Linkerd Heroes are community members who best represent the spirit of the
Linkerd community. Whether it's helping others, answering questions, sharing
their successes (and failures!) with the world at large, or contributing code or
docs, Linkerd Heroes are instrumental in making the Linkerd community the
amazing place it is today.

## Congrats, TJ Miller!

This month's hero is
[TJ Miller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tj-miller-16b827b0/). TJ spearheaded the
PR for injecting the Linkerd proxy as a native sidecar container. Linkerd has
relied on the sidecar pattern since its humble beginnings, but Kubernetes
version 1.29 finally adds first-class support for sidecars to Kubernetes itself.
Allowing Linkerd to use this new feature is a definite improvement for many
users, and we thank TJ for thoroughly researching this feature and implementing
it impeccably. Working with him and bringing this exciting improvement to full
fruition was a pleasure!

community's pressing questions on Slack. Maybe you've read a blog post or
watched a conference talk that helped spur your decision-making process or
advance your Linkerd implementation. Or perhaps someone contributed an awesome
Linkerd feature or bugfix that has made your life a lot easier. Who is your
Linkerd Hero? Submit your nomination for
