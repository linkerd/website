## Announcing July's Linkerd Hero

We are excited to announce this month's Linkerd Hero: Mikael Fridh. Congrats,
Mikael!

## What are Linkerd Heroes?

Linkerd Heroes are community members who best represent the spirit of the
Linkerd community. Whether it's helping others, answering questions, sharing
their successes (and failures!) with the world at large, or contributing code or
docs, Linkerd Heroes are instrumental in making the Linkerd community the
amazing place it is today.

## Congrats, Mikael!

This month's hero is [Mikael Fridh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikaelfridh/).
Mikael reported an incompatibility between Linkerd's CNI plugin and newer
versions of EKS's VPC CNI plugin. He demonstrated great domain insight by
quickly providing a succinct fix, that we immediately incorporated into the 2.12
and 2.13 branches of Linkerd. Thank you, Mikael, for helping rapidly fixing
issues, improving everyone's Linkerd experience!

Linkerd feature or bugfix that has made your life a lot easier.
