Yesterday, [CVE-2023-44487](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-44487), a
DDOS vulnerability in many HTTP/2 implementations, was disclosed. This is a very
interesting attack involving the specifics of how HTTP/2 multiplexes concurrent
requests on the same TCP connection, and there are several great writeups on how
it works—see e.g. Cloudflare's [HTTP/2 Rapid Reset: deconstructing the
record-breaking
attack](https://blog.cloudflare.com/technical-breakdown-http2-rapid-reset-ddos-attack/)
and Google's [How it works: The novel HTTP/2 ‘Rapid Reset’ DDoS
attack](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/how-it-works-the-novel-http2-rapid-reset-ddos-attack)
for details of how this attack works and the consequences.

We're happy to report that due to Linkerd's internal security policies and the
security-awareness and rapid response of the Rust community, all recent versions
of Linkerd are resilient to this class of DDOS attack. In fact, Linkerd has been
resilient to these attacks since April of this year!

Specifically, versions of Linkerd that are resilient to CVE-2023-44487 include:

* All versions of Linkerd 2.14.x
* Linkerd 2.13.1 and all later minor versions of Linkerd 2.13
* Linkerd 2.12.5 and all later minor versions of Linkerd 2.12

Linkerd solved this vulnerability 6 months ago thanks in part to our dependency
handling procedures, but mostly thanks to the the security-mindedness of the
Rust community.

Let's see just how this feat happened.

## Linkerd is a security-first project

It's no understatement to say that Linkerd treats security as a critical
requirement. Organizations around the world rely on Linkerd for everything from
protecting sensitive customer medical and financial data, to scheduling COVID
tests, to building 911 call centers. For some people, Linkerd is quite literally
a life-or-death project.

Part of that approach is the choice of technologies like Rust, of course, which
allow us to avoid an entire class of buffer overflow exploits and other
vulnerabilities that are [endemic to languages like C and
C++](https://www.zdnet.com/article/chrome-70-of-all-security-bugs-are-memory-safety-issues/).

But another, just as important part is simply how seriously the project takes
potential security vulnerabilities. Tracing the path to resolution for
CVE-2023-44487 is a great example of that. Here's how it happened:

This issue was first tracked as a vulnerability in the Rust community as
[RUSTSEC-2023-0034](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0034.html) on
April 14, 2023. At that point it had actually [already been fixed in
`h2`](https://seanmonstar.com/post/730794151136935936/hyper-http2-rapid-reset-unaffected),
the underlying library that Linkerd uses to handle HTTP/2 requests, as a change
that had gone out [on April 12th, two days
earlier](https://github.com/hyperium/h2/pull/668).

The fix was published in [`h2`
v0.3.17](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2023-0034.html). Linkerd
automatically flagged that dependency [on April
13th](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2-proxy/commit/67306bc7ba19286352762362e4e1876ce5924442)
through [GitHub's Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot), the automated
dependency tool that Linkerd uses to ensure it stays up-to-date with critical
dependencies. The Linkerd team published the update as [proxy release
v2.198.1](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2-proxy/releases/tag/release%2Fv2.198.1).

On April 13th, this new proxy version [was pulled into the main Linkerd
repo](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/commit/19a404fd196e251e969ac6c4a552a3c7af698dc5).
On April 14th, we pushed it to [Linkerd
2.13.1](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/stable-2.13.1)—two days
after the underlying fix in `h2`, and the same day it was recognized as an
vulnerability in the Rust ecosystem. The fix also went out on
[edge-23.4.2](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/edge-23.4.2) on
April 21st, and from there it was in all future and stable releases.

In short: **two days after the fix was made in the underlying Rust HTTP/2 library,
it was already in the hands of Linkerd users as a stable release, and all
Linkerd releases since April have been protected against this vulnerability.**
While this vulnerability is making the news this week, Linkerd adopters have
been protected for almost 6 months.

## h2, hyper, and more

But what is `h2` anyways? The [h2](https://github.com/hyperium/h2) library and
its companion [hyper](https://hyper.rs/) are two of the foundational libraries
that Linkerd uses to handle HTTP/2 requests in the proxy. HTTP/2 is used
extensively by Linkerd: not only does Linkerd proxy application-initiated HTTP/2
and gRPC (which uses HTTP/2) requests, Linkerd also transparently upgrades all
HTTP/1 communication in between two meshed pods to HTTP/2! This is part of
Linkerd's magic: by using `h2`, we can can dramatically reduce TCP connection
usage and improve performance and resiliency for inter-service HTTP traffic
without the application needing to do anything.

Like much of the Rust async networking stack, these libraries represent the
pinnacle of modern network programming. The Linkerd team has been heavily
involved in `h2` for years. [Buoyant](https://buoyant.io), the primary sponsor
of Linkerd, also sponsored significant portions of h2 development, and Linkerd
maintainers occupy the third and fourth spots on the [`h2` contributor
leaderboard](https://github.com/hyperium/h2/graphs/contributors).

But ultimately it is to the credit of `h2` maintainer Sean McArthur that
[CVE-2023-44487 was addressed six months
ago](https://seanmonstar.com/post/730794151136935936/hyper-http2-rapid-reset-unaffected),
allowing Linkerd to maintain its commitment to security and simplicity for its
users everywhere around the globe. A heartfelt thanks to you, Sean.
