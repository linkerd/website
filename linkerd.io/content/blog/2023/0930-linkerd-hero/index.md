We are excited to announce this month's Linkerd Hero: Cameron Boulton. Congrats,
Cameron!

## What are Linkerd Heroes?

Linkerd Heroes are community members who best represent the spirit of the
Linkerd community. Whether it's helping others, answering questions, sharing
their successes (and failures!) with the world at large, or contributing code or
docs, Linkerd Heroes are instrumental in making the Linkerd community the
amazing place it is today.

## Congrats, Cameron Boulton!

This month's hero is
[Cameron Boulton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameronboulton/). Cameron did a
fantastic investigation on distributed-tracing integration between Datadog and
Linkerd, and contributed fixes to help community members more easily configure
Linkerd distributed tracing using Linkerd's Jaeger extension (regardless of
which collector is in use). Thank you, Cameron, for making future Datadog and
Linkerd users' lives easier!

community's pressing questions on Slack. Maybe you've read a blog post or
watched a conference talk that helped spur your decision-making process or
advance your Linkerd implementation. Or perhaps someone contributed an awesome
Linkerd feature or bugfix that has made your life a lot easier. Who is your
Linkerd Hero? Submit your nomination for
