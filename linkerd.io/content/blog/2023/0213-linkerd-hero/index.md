We are excited to announce this month's Linkerd Hero: Yu Cao. Congrats, Yu!

## What are Linkerd Heroes?

Linkerd Heroes are community members who best represent the spirit of the
Linkerd community. Whether it's helping others, answering questions, sharing
their successes (and failures!) with the world at large, or contributing code or
docs, Linkerd Heroes are instrumental in making the Linkerd community the
amazing place it is today.

## Congrats, Yu Cao!

This month's hero is [Yu Cao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yu-cao-6218a46/). Yu
recently [added Linkerd support](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/pull/10186)
for Kubernetes `internalTrafficPolicy` for Linkerd workloads. His contributions
permit Linkerd users to save money and improve performance by allowing them to
better control traffic for their workloads. Thank you, Yu, for contributing code
and helping make Linkerd even better for our community!

communityâ€™s pressing questions on Slack. Maybe you've read a blog post or
watched a conference talk that helped spur your decision-making process or
advance your Linkerd implementation. Or perhaps someone contributed an awesome
Linkerd feature or bugfix that has made your life a lot easier. Who is your
Linkerd Hero? Submit your nomination for
