# Announcing November's Linkerd Hero

We are excited to announce this month's Linkerd Hero: Takumi. Congrats, Takumi! 

## What are Linkerd Heroes?

Linkerd Heroes are community members who best represent the spirit of the
Linkerd community. Whether it's helping others, answering questions,
sharing their successes (and failures!) with the world at large, or
contributing code or docs, Linkerd Heroes are instrumental in making
the Linkerd community the amazing place it is today.

## Congrats, Takumi!

This month's hero is [Takumi](https://github.com/mikutas). Over the past
three years, Takumi has regularly contributed fixes to Linkerd’s code
base. From CLI fixes to Helm template and control plane changes, Takumi
has positively impacted the project. Thank you for being such a prolific
contributor and dedicating your time to making Linkerd an even more
awesome project!
