Over the past 18 months, the adoption of Linkerd has skyrocketed in enterprise
environments, with companies like
[Adidas](https://buoyant.io/case-studies/adidas),
[Microsoft](https://buoyant.io/case-studies/xbox),
[Plaid](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2023/07/17/plaid-pain-free-deployments-at-global-scale/),
and [DB Schenker](https://buoyant.io/case-studies/schenker) deploying Linkerd to
bring security, compliance, and reliability to their mission-critical production
infrastructure. Today, we're happy to announce the release of Linkerd 2.14 with
improved support for multi-cluster deployments on shared flat networks, full
Gateway API conformance, and much more.

The 2.14 release comes just four months after our massive [Linkerd 2.13 release
with circuit breaking and dynamic request
routing](https://buoyant.io/blog/announcing-linkerd-2-13-circuit-breaking-dynamic-request-routing-fips),
and continues Linkerd's focus on coupling enterprise-grade power and flexibility
with the best operational model simplicity and lowest TCO of any service mesh.

This release includes a lot of hard work from 25+ contributors. A special thank
you to [Amir Karimi](https://github.com/AMK9978), [Amit
Kumar](https://github.com/amit-62), [Andre

## Multi-cluster support for shared flat networks

Linkerd 2.14 introduces improved multi-cluster support for clusters deployed on
a shared flat network. Increasingly common in enterprise environments, this
network architecture allows pods in different clusters to establish TCP
connections with each other. Linkerd takes advantage of this ability to add a
new "gateway-less" mode for cross-cluster communication. In this mode, Linkerd
establishes cross-cluster connections across clusters without transiting a
multi-cluster gateway. This improves performance by reducing the latency of
cross-cluster calls; it improves security by preserving workload identity in
mTLS calls across clusters; and it reduces cloud spend by reducing the amount of
traffic that is routed through the multi-cluster gateway.

Of course, Linkerd ensures that these cross-cluster connections are established
with all the same guarantees as in-cluster connections: they are fully
transparent to the application with the same security, reliability, and
observability capabilities, including encryption, authentication, and
zero-trust-capable authorization policies. This mode is also purely additive,
and in heterogeneous network environments where flat networks are not possible,
Linkerd's existing gateway-based approach functions as normal.

Importantly, this new multi-cluster support retains a critical aspect to
Linkerd's design: independence of clusters as a way of isolating security and
failure domains. Each cluster runs its own Linkerd control plane, and the
failure of a single cluster cannot take down the service mesh on other clusters.
(And Linkerd provides a set of powerful techniques including [cross-cluster
failover](/2.14/tasks/automatic-failover/) that can be used to automatically
route traffic to the remaining clusters.)

For more details on Linkerd's new support for multi-cluster across flat
networks, see [Enterprise multi-cluster at scale: supporting flat networks in
Linkerd](/2023/07/20/enterprise-multi-cluster-at-scale-supporting-flat-networks-in-linkerd/).

## Gateway API conformance

Starting way back in the Linkerd 2.12 release, Linkerd has been on the forefront
of adopting Kubernetes's new [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) as
the core configuration mechanism for Linkerd, including for features such as
[zero trust authorization
policy](https://linkerd.io/2.13/features/server-policy/) and [dynamic request
routing](https://linkerd.io/2.13/features/request-routing/). Adopting the
Gateway API has a whole host of benefits for users, from providing standardized
mechanisms for configuring complex resources such as classes of HTTP requests to
providing a uniform API across ingress and service meshes to—most importantly
for Linkerd's philosophy of minimalism—reduction of additional configuration
surface area, since the Gateway configuration resources that already live on the
cluster.

In the Linkerd 2.14 release we're happy to report that Linkerd is now fully
conformant with the mesh profile of the Gateway API. This means that Linkerd now
uses the core gateway.networking.k8s.io types, and that features like retries,
timeouts, and progressive delivery are now fully configurable via these types
without the requirement to use the earlier ServiceProfile resources.

The Linkerd team has been co-leading the GAMMA initiative to adapt the Gateway
API to service mesh use cases, and we're looking forward to watching this
standard evolve over time.

## And lots more!

Linkerd 2.14 also has a tremendous list of other improvements, performance
enhancements, and bug fixes, including:

* A new `-o json` flag for the linkerd multicluster gateways command
* A new `logFormat` value to the multicluster Link Helm Chart (thanks
  @bunnybilou!)
* New leader-election capabilities to the service-mirror controller
* A new high-availability (HA) mode for the multicluster service-mirror
* A new `outbound_http_balancer_endpoints` metric
* A fix for missing route_ metrics for requests with ServiceProfiles
* A fix for proxy startup failure when using the `config.linkerd.io/admin-port`
  annotation.
* The `linkerd diagnostics policy` command now displays outbound policy when
   the target resource is a Service
* A fix for HA validation checks when Linkerd is installed with Helm.
* A fix for the `linkerd viz check` command so that it will wait until the viz
  extension becomes ready
* A new `-o jsonpath` flag to linkerd viz tap to allow filtering output fields
* Tolerations and nodeSelector support in extensions namespace-metadata Jobs
* Build improvements for multi-arch build artifacts. Thanks @MarkSRobinson!!

And more. See the [full release
notes](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/stable-2.14.0) for
details.

## What's next?

Last year was a banner year for Linkerd—the [number of stable Kubernetes
clusters running Linkerd doubled in
2022](https://linkerd.io/2022/12/28/service-mesh-2022-recap-ebpf-gateway-api/),
and the project gained [multi-cluster
failover](https://linkerd.io/2022/03/09/announcing-automated-multi-cluster-failover-for-kubernetes/)
and [full L7 authorization policy based on the Gateway
API](https://buoyant.io/blog/announcing-linkerd-2-12). In 2023, with Linkerd
2.13 and 2.14 already under our belts, we're off to a great pace. We have some
amazing features and ideas up our sleeves that we can't wait to unveil later
this year. Stay tuned!
