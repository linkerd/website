_This blog post is based on a workshop that Russ Parmer of WeaveWorks and I
delivered at Buoyant’s
[Service Mesh Academy](https://buoyant.io/service-mesh-academy). If this seems
interesting, check out the
[full recording](https://buoyant.io/service-mesh-academy/real-world-gitops-with-flagger-and-linkerd)!_

"GitOps" and "service mesh" may not be things you immediately think of together
– but maybe they should be! These two wildly different technologies are each
enormously capable independently, and combined they deliver far more than the
sum of their parts. In this blog post, I'll walk you through what you need to
know to use Flux, Flagger, and Linkerd together for successful GitOps in the
real world.

## Why Are We Here?

First, though, let's talk a bit about what we can - and can't - really do in the
structure of a static-text blog post. **This post will not make you a GitOps
expert by itself.** GitOps is complex, and there's no actual substitute for
practice. You can't get that from reading a blog post.

What we _can_ deliver here, though, is a careful look at the good, the bad, and
the ugly of making GitOps actually work. We'll talk about concepts and
conventions, about what works well and what doesn't, and we'll equip you to get
the most out of the practice you put in later.

Finally, don't forget that we have a ready-made demo repo for you to practice
with! You can find that at <https://github.com/BuoyantIO/gitops-linkerd> --
check out its [README.md] for the full instructions.

## A Quick Introduction to GitOps

If you're completely new to GitOps, you may find all the definitions talking
about "continuous deployment" and "single immutable source of truth" to be more
confusing than helpful. A simple way to view GitOps for our purposes is that
it's a way to manage configuration of a cluster by putting the configuration we
want in a git repository, then having software that makes the cluster match the
repo.

In other words, you don't make changes to your cluster by running
`kubectl apply`: you do it with a Git commit.

This might seem like a step backward, but it's a wonderful way to accomplish two
things that are very important in production:

- You can always know exactly what configuration your cluster is running.
- You can always know who made a particular change.

These two things open the door to a host of good things because _knowing the
state of the cluster means you can easily replicate it_. Knowledge is power.

Under the hood, we'll use Flux and Flagger, both from WeaveWorks, to make this
work.

### Flux

A Kubernetes cluster can't natively interact with a git repo. Flux is a tool
that bridges the gap: a Flux agent runs in your cluster and watches for changes
in the repo and in the cluster. Whenever it notices a change (in either place),
it does whatever it needs to do to make the cluster look like the repo.

**Note**: Flux will only make the _cluster_ look like the _repo_. There's no
provision to go the other direction, because it would be a terrible idea! The
whole point of GitOps is that the git repo holds the truth of what state you
want, so allowing the repo to modify it would not be an antipattern.

Flux is fairly simple: it can read Git repos from GitHub or GitLab, and you
point it to a directory in the repo that contains YAML files defining Flux
_Kustomizations_. A Kustomization definition includes three critical components:

- The _source_ tells Flux where to go to read the base resources that should
  exist in the cluster. A source can be a directory in a Git repo or a Helm
  chart.

- An optional set of _patches_, which are standard JSONpatch definitions, tell
  Flux how to modify the base resources before applying them to the cluster.

- An optional list of _dependencies_ tells Flux which other Kustomizations must
  be applied before applying this one.

The combination of these three is quite powerful while being relatively simple
(though I'll be the first to acknowledge that JSONpatch isn't always pleasant to
use). We'll dig into how to approach Kustomizations, and what a typical
Kustomization might look like, shortly.

### Flagger

Flagger is a companion to Flux that's specifically dealing with progressive
delivery. This is the idea that when you deploy a new version of a workload, you
should slowly ramp traffic over to it to make sure that the new version will
work, rather than just instantly cutting all the traffic over to the new
(possibly broken) version.

What can initially seem strange about Flagger is that you don't explicitly
supply a resource that says "please do a progressive rollout now". Instead, you
just edit a Deployment, and Flagger takes it from there: it notices any change
to objects under its management and _automatically_ tweaks things in the cluster
to set up a progressive rollout.

This means that Flagger needs a a way to control the amount of traffic that goes
to the new version. It doesn't do this directly: instead, it needs to alter
configuration for some other piece of the system to actually do the traffic
shifting. Flagger has a few different options for this:

- For workloads at the top of the call graph, it can work with several ingress
  controllers directly;

- It can use SMI TrafficSplits for traffic anywhere in the call graph; or

- It can use Gateway API HTTPRoutes.

(At the moment, Linkerd relies on the SMI TrafficSplit mechanism. More on this
in a bit.)

---

## A Quick Introduction to Linkerd

If you haven't run across Linkerd before now, it's a service mesh: an
infrastructure layer providing security, reliability, and observability features
at a platform level, without having to modify your application. It's currently
the only CNCF graduated service mesh, in fact, offering excellent security,
best-in-class operational simplicity, and the least overhead of any production
service mesh.

Like most other meshes, Linkerd works by placing a sidecar proxy next to each
workload container, and allowing the sidecar to intercept all traffic to and
from the workload. This low-level access permits Linkerd to have enormous
control and visibility over what's happening with network communications in the
cluster.

Linkerd supports both the SMI TrafficSplit resource and (as of 2.12) the Gateway
API HTTPRoute resource. However, in 2.12 and 2.13, Linkerd's HTTPRoute support
is limited, meaning that Flagger needs to use the SMI TrafficSplit interface.

## Putting It Into Practice: Flux

As with many things, the jump from basic theory to actual practice can be
tricky. A good way to start is with the demo repo mentioned above,
<https://github.com/BuoyantIO/gitops-linkerd>. Its [README.md] has full
instructions for how to get everything running, but let's hit the highlights and
the gotchas here too.

You'll need to start by having an empty cluster, a working `kubectl` command,
and the `flux` CLI. Check out <https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/> for full
instructions, but the easy way on Mac and Linux is
`brew install fluxcd/tap/flux`.

### Repo Layout and `flux bootstrap`

Something very important to understand is that, when working with Flux, you'll
generally set up all your Kustomizations, install Flux to your local machine,
then run `flux bootstrap` to tell Flux to set up everything in the cluster for
you! You don't set up the cluster by hand at any point.

When you run `flux bootstrap`, you tell Flux the git repo to use, and the branch
and path within that repo to to start looking in your repo for its
configuration. This brings up two really important points:

1. Flux will need access to your Git repo, which is typically going to mean that
   it'll need access to GitHub or GitLab, which means you'll need to set up an
   access token for Flux to use.

   For full details here, check out
   <https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/#bootstrap> -- but the gotcha is that
   Flux needs to be able to write as well as read (for example, with GitHub it
   needs to be able to create deploy keys). **Read carefully** about the
   permissions to set up the token.

2. If you're trying to understand a Flux setup, **you** will need to know what
   branch and path were given to `flux bootstrap`, so that you'll know where to
   start reading to figure out what's going on.

In this blog post, we're not going to include the full `flux bootstrap` command
for the `gitops-linkerd`: we want to focus on concepts and gotchas, not all the
details of setting up Git permissions and such. Check out the `README.md` in the
`gitops-linkerd` repo for all the bootstrap details.

However, it's very much worth looking at a couple of things in our
`gitops-linkerd` repo's configuration. The starting point for its configuration
is the `clusters/my-cluster` directory on the `main` branch, in which you'll
find all the needed definitions for the cluster infrastructure _and_ a reference
to another repo for the application itself. If you want to use this for your own
Flux/Flagger/Linkerd setup, a good start would be to leave the cluster
infrastructure alone, but to replace the application definition with your own.

`clusters/my-cluster` uses a fairly typical Flux layout:

- `infrastructure.yaml` tells Flux about cluster infrastructure to set up;

- `apps.yaml` tells Flux about the application(s) we want to run over that
  infrastructure; and

- `flux-system` is a directory with customization of Flux itself. We're not
  going to get into `flux-system` in this blog post, but it's good to know what
  it is.

The split between "infrastructure" and "app" is blurry, and largely convention,
but if you want to use `gitops-linkerd` as the basis of your own cluster
definition, you can likely focus on `apps.yaml` and leave the cluster
infrastructure alone at first.

### `gitops-linkerd` Cluster Infrastructure

`infrastructure.yaml` defines five separate components for cluster
infrastructure. Each of these is represented by a separate document in this YAML
file:

- cert-manager
- Linkerd
- NGINX
- Flagger
- Weave GitOps

(Recall that Flux itself is the only thing we install by hand. Also, Weave
GitOps is a dashboard for Flux; check it out at
<https://www.cncf.io/blog/2023/04/24/how-to-use-weave-gitops-as-your-flux-ui/>.)

Importantly, `infrastructure.yaml` also defines the dependencies between these
components; this is an especially powerful aspect of Flux. We'll take a quick
look at the first two elements here: `cert-manager` and `linkerd`.

#### The `cert-manager` component

The first document in `infrastructure.yaml` looks like this:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Kustomization
metadata:
  name: cert-manager
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 1h
  retryInterval: 1m
  timeout: 5m
  prune: true
  wait: true
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: flux-system
  path: ./infrastructure/cert-manager
```

There are few things to understand here:

- `name: cert-manager` sets the name of the Kustomization. This is how we'll
  refer to this component when describing dependencies.

- `namespace: flux-system` places the Kustomization itself in the `flux-system`
  namespace; this does not mean that cert-manager will live in `flux-system`,
  though.

  By convention, `flux-system` is the home for core elements of cluster
  infrastructure, with other namespaces used for applications.

- There's no `dependsOn` attribute, so this Kustomization doesn't depend on
  anything.

- `sourceRef` is a bit magic: referring to the `flux-system` `GitRepository`
  really means "the same Git repo as the Kustomization itself".

- `path: ./infrastructure/cert-manager` tells us where in the source to look for
  more files for this Kustomization.

- `wait: true` means that Flux will wait for everything installed to be ready
  before proceeding with other Kustomizations.

- `interval: 1h` means that Flux will check once an hour to see if there are new
  changes that need to be handled.

If we look into `./infrastructure/cert-manager`, we'll find a few files:

```text {class=disable-copy}
kustomization.yaml
namespace.yaml
release.yaml
repository.yaml
```

The place to start reading is always `kustomization.yaml`, which is simple here:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
namespace: cert-manager
resources:
  - namespace.yaml
  - repository.yaml
  - release.yaml
```

This tells Flux to apply those three YAML files. We're not going to dig too far
into them here - the `gitops-linkerd` demo goes into much more detail - but it's
important to know that

- `namespace.yaml` creates the `cert-manager` namespace;
- `repository.yaml` tells Flux to `helm repo add` a Helm repository; and
- `release.yaml` tells Flux to `helm install` a chart from the repo added by
  `repository.yaml`.

Note that this is actually an _unordered_ list: `kustomize` automatically sorts
all the resources contained in all of these files to make sure that the the
resources it's working with are applied in the correct order.

We're going to leave the deep dive into these files for the `gitops-linkerd`
demo itself, except for one note: if you look at `repository.yaml` and
`release.yaml`, you'll see that they define resources in the `cert-manager`
namespace, not the `flux-system` namespace. This is a pattern you'll see again
and again: the resources managed by the Kustomization should go in a namespace
appropriate for the component being managed.

So the three important concepts to take away from this are:

1. You don't have to apply any patches in a Kustomization, despite its name.
2. You can apply Kubernetes resources _and_ higher-level Flux resources in a
   Kustomization.
3. The resources created and managed by the Kustomization belong in an
   appropriate namespace for the component, not `flux-system`.

You'll see these same concepts over and over as you look at the `gitops-linkerd`
definitions.

#### The `linkerd` component

The second document in `infrastructure.yaml` defines the `linkerd` component:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Kustomization
metadata:
  name: linkerd
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  dependsOn:
    - name: cert-manager
  interval: 1h
  retryInterval: 1m
  timeout: 5m
  prune: true
  wait: true
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: flux-system
  path: ./infrastructure/linkerd
```

Much of this lines up with the `cert-manager` Kustomization: we have a `name`,
we're still in the `flux-system` namespace, we'll find more files in
`./infrastructure/linkerd`, etc.

The main difference is the new `dependsOn` attribute, which says that the
`linkerd` Kustomization depends on the `cert-manager` Kustomization. (Note, too,
that `dependsOn` takes an array value, so you can list many dependencies.) This
is one of the most powerful features of Flux: defining complex start ordering is
just a matter of explaining what depends on what, then letting Flux do all the
hard work.

Taking a quick look into the `./infrastructure/linkerd` directory, we'll find
quite a lot more to read than we did for `cert-manager`:

```text {class=disable-copy}
README.md
ca.crt
ca.key
kustomization.yaml
kustomizeconfig.yaml
linkerd-certs.yaml
linkerd-control-plane.yaml
linkerd-crds.yaml
linkerd-smi.yaml
linkerd-viz.yaml
namespaces.yaml
repositories.yaml
```

As before, though, the place to start reading is still `kustomization.yaml`.
It's more complex, since we're installing four separate Linkerd components (its
CRDs, the control plane, the SMI extension, and the Viz extension) and we need
to configure Linkerd to use custom secrets from cert-manager - but you'll be
able to see it all laid out in the files.

Again, we'll mostly leave the deep dive for the `gitops-linkerd` demo, but it's
worth pointing out that where the `cert-manager` Kustomization had a
`repository.yaml` file, the `linkerd` Kustomization has `repositories.yaml`,
with the name pluralized. The name doesn't matter at all to Flux, since it has
to be listed explicitly in `kustomization.yaml`: this means you're free to
choose names that help later readers follow what's going on.

There's a lot more in the `infrastructure.yaml` file, but we're going to leave
the rest for the `gitops-linkerd` demo and your own reading. Let's continue on
to the application.

### `gitops-linkerd` Application

The `gitops-linkerd` repo is set up to install the [Faces demo] as its
application. This is defined in `clusters/my-cluster/apps.yaml`, which is set up
basically exactly the same way as `infrastructure.yaml`:

[Faces demo]: https://github.com/BuoyantIO/faces-demo/

```yaml
---
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: Kustomization
metadata:
  name: apps
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  dependsOn:
    - name: flagger
    - name: ingress-nginx
  interval: 10m
  retryInterval: 1m
  timeout: 5m
  prune: true
  wait: true
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: flux-system
  path: ./apps
```

Things worth noting here:

- We're checking for changes every ten minutes, not every hour.
- We explicitly list only `flagger` and `ingress-nginx` as dependencies, because
  those two are the leaves of our infrastructure dependency graph. Flux will
  figure out all the rest from there.

You'll also notice, when you look in `./apps`, that things in there look quite
different. First, the only thing in `./apps` is another directory, `faces`. This
is because Flux is well-suited to managing multiple applications at the same
time: since it automatically recurses into directories, we can just have a
separate directory per app.

As always, for the `faces` app, we start with its
`./apps/faces/kustomization.yaml` file:

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
namespace: faces
resources:
  - namespace.yaml
  - faces-sync.yaml
  - faces-ingress.yaml
  - faces-canary.yaml
  - faces-abtest.yaml
```

This part looks straightforward, except that the names imply that things are
very different from our infrastructure. Again, we'll leave the really deep dive
for the `gitops-linkerd` demo, but there are a few concepts worth looking at
here.

#### `kustomization.yaml` Defines the App Namespace

First note that the Kustomization has a toplevel `namespace` attribute, rather
than having `metadata.name` and `metadata.namespace`. The toplevel `namespace`
attribute sets the namespace for every resource referenced in this
Kustomization, _whether or not the resource tries to define the namespace
itself_.

The idea here is that it makes it easy to clone an application and place it in
whatever namespace fits your needs, without having to edit each individual
`metadata.namespace`.

#### `faces-sync.yaml` Uses a Git Repository

The Kustomization references `faces-sync.yaml`; if we look in that file, we see
a Git repo as a source, rather than a Helm chart:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: GitRepository
metadata:
  name: faces
spec:
  interval: 10m
  url: https://github.com/BuoyantIO/faces-demo
  ref:
    branch: main
  ignore: |
    /*
    !/k8s/01-base/*-profile.yaml
    !/k8s/01-base/faces.yaml
    !/k8s/01-base/faces-gui.yaml
```

- We use the `https` URL to the Git repo so that Flux does not need any special
  permissions: it's just reading a public repository from GitHub.

- `ref.branch: main` tells Flux to look at the `main` branch.

- Finally, the `ignore` attribute is important and easy to overlook: there is a
  _lot_ of stuff in the `faces-demo` repo, and Flux needs almost none of it! So
  we can explicitly tell Flux to ignore _everything_ except the few files we
  need to pay attention to.

- `faces-sync.yaml` also defines some patches to be applied to the files it
  pulls from GitHub. These are described in the `gitops-linkerd` demo.

#### `faces-canary.yaml` and `faces-abtest.yaml` Set Up Flagger

We'll talk more about these in the Flagger section, below.

### Bootstrapping the Cluster

After all this background, we can talk about what happens when you actually run
`flux bootstrap`! It's a beautiful example of an awful lot of complexity made
into a simple thing for a user.

(Once again, we're deliberately not giving the full `flux bootstrap` command for
the `gitops-linkerd` in this blog post. Check out the `README.md` in the
`gitops-linkerd` repo for all the bootstrap details.)

1. First, `flux bootstrap` will set up access to the Git repo you point it to.
   It'll verify its credentials, check out the correct branch, create deploy
   keys, etc.

2. Next, it'll look at all the YAML files in the starting directory you give it.
   It'll use these to do any necessary configuration of Flux itself and,
   critically, build the whole dependency graph.

3. After that, it will start walking the dependency graph, installing things as
   efficiently as it can. Flux is perfectly happy to work in parallel wherever
   it can, only blocking components where needed.

A very very important Flux CLI command is `flux get kustomizations` -- this will
show you all the Kustomizations that Flux knows about and, critically, their
status. You can also use the Weave GitOps UI for a graphical view here. This is
so useful during bootstrap that `flux get kustomizations --watch` will give you
a continuously updating view.

A final critical point: since nothing depends on our application, Flux will
_not_ wait for the application to be ready and running before declaring success!
To make sure that the app is running after `flux bootstrap` completes, either
add a dummy component that depends on the application, or (much simpler!) just
use `kubectl rollout status` to wait for your application to be ready.

### The Biggest Flux Gotcha Of All

Once in operation, Flux is fairly straightforward, with one big exception: it's
not really possible to watch Git repositories in any standard way, so Flux polls
for changes. This polling can be fairly slow, because often it's just not a big
deal if it takes several minutes or an hour to catch a change and roll it out.

Of course, that changes if you're actively developing something! It can be quite
disorienting to push a commit and then have nothing happen. While you can crank
the poll interval down to make this better, a better plan might be to use the
`flux reconcile` command to trigger an immediate pass over a given
Kustomization, e.g.

```bash
flux reconcile kustomization apps --with-source
```

An important note for `flux reconcile` is that it will _not_ recursively
reconcile other Kustomizations contained within the one you pass it on the
command line. This matters for the Kustomizations in the `gitops-linkerd` repo:
`apps` includes a Kustomization for `faces` that points to a separate Git repo.
If we change something in that secondary Git repo and we want to trigger a new
reconciliation, we need to explicitly tell Flux to look at the `faces`
Kustomization (which, remember, is in the `faces` namespace):

```bash
flux reconcile kustomization faces -n faces --with-source
```

---

## Putting It Into Practice: Flagger

Flux gives you a very powerful set of tools for managing your cluster by
committing to a Git repo rather than directly modifying the cluster. Flagger
builds on Flux by introducing progressive deployment: rather than updating a
Deployment to a new version all at once, Flagger can move traffic gracefully to
a new version and monitor how well the new version works, making it much safer
to do live updates.

Flagger relies on external components to make this happen:

- First, some external thing needs to be able to shift traffic smoothly from the
  old version to the new version. This could be an ingress controller for things
  at the edge of the call graph, or an SMI TrafficSplit or Gateway API HTTPRoute
  for things deeper in the call graph.

  `gitops-linkerd` shows how to use NGINX and Linkerd's SMI extension for this
  purpose. Future versions of Linkerd will also support the HTTPRoute mechanism.

- Second, Flagger needs to monitor external metrics to be sure that the new
  version is working, and it needs to know how the Deployments you want to work
  with are labeled. These are both set by supplying values to the Flagger Helm
  chart.

In `gitops-linkerd`, we set up Flagger in `infrastructure/flagger/release.yaml`,
supplying the following values to Helm:

```yaml
values:
  meshProvider: linkerd
  metricsServer: http://prometheus.linkerd-viz:9090
  selectorLabels: app,name,app.kubernetes.io/name,service
```

In order:

- `meshProvider` tells Flagger the service mesh in play.

- `metricsServer` points Flagger to the same Prometheus that Linkerd's Viz
  extension uses for its metrics. **Flagger must use the same Prometheus as
  Linkerd Viz for this to work.** If you point Linkerd Viz to a new Prometheus
  instance, you must change Flagger's configuration as well.

- `selectorLabels` tells Flagger about the labels Deployments will use to find
  their Pods. The Faces demo mostly uses `service`, which is not part of the
  `selectorLabels` list by default.

### Flagger Canaries

Where Flux commonly deals with Kustomization resources, Flagger commonly deals
with Canary resources, named for the common "canary" deployment pattern where a
new version gets a small amount of traffic shifted to it, then slowly more and
more until it's taking all the load. Flagger can also manage an A/B deployment
pattern, where the new version takes all traffic marked with a particular header
or the like: you'll still use a Canary resource for this, though.

Let's look at one of the Canary definitions for `gitops-linkerd`. This is the
first document in `apps/faces/faces-canary.yaml`:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: flagger.app/v1beta1
kind: Canary
metadata:
  name: face
spec:
  provider: linkerd
  targetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: face
  progressDeadlineSeconds: 60
  service:
    port: 80
    targetPort: http
  analysis:
    interval: 10s
    threshold: 3
    maxWeight: 50
    stepWeight: 5
    metrics:
      - name: request-success-rate
        thresholdRange:
          min: 70
        interval: 1m
    webhooks:
      - name: load-test
        type: rollout
        url: http://flagger-loadtester.flagger-system/
        metadata:
          cmd: "hey -z 2m -q 10 -c 2 http://face-canary.faces/"
```

As always, the really deep dive will happen in the `gitops-linkerd` demo, but
let's take a look at the highlights here:

- The `targetRef` specifies which resource we need to watch for changes. In this
  case, it's the Deployment named `face`. (Flagger also knows how to handle
  DaemonSets, but the target must be in the same namespace as the Canary.)

- `provider: linkerd` means that we want Flagger to interact with Linkerd to
  shift traffic (by managing an SMI TrafficSplit).

  - The `service` attribute tells Flagger which traffic, exactly, needs to be
    shifted. This needs to match up with a port defined in the Deployment.

- In the `analysis` section, several attributes work together to define how
  quickly traffic is shifted.

  - As shown, we'll start with 0% traffic, then every 10 seconds
    (`analysis.interval`) we'll shift another 5% of traffic
    (`analysis.stepWeight`). Once we hit 50% (`analysis.maxWeight`) we'll call
    it good, and go to 100%.

  - The overall effect is that if all goes well, it will take just shy of two
    minutes to shift all the traffic to the new version. The analysis section
    gives you a lot of control to tune this so that it fits your application's
    needs.

- `analysis.metrics` describes how to determine that things are going OK. Here,
  we'll look at the `request-success-rate`, and require it to be over 70%.
  (`request-success-rate` is a builtin analysis metric for Flagger: it means
  look at the Prometheus that Flagger was configured to use, and check the
  success rate for the service being canaried.)

- `analysis.threshold` describes when the test has failed. In this case, if we
  see three instances of the success rate falling before 70%, we abort the
  rollout.

- `analysis.webhooks` is using Flagger's builtin load generator to provide load
  to the canary to make sure that our metrics are meaningful. For more on this,
  see <https://docs.flagger.app/usage/webhooks#load-testing>.

### Flagger A/B Tests

Where a canary rollout slowly shifts traffic over time as long as things
succeed, and finishes once all the traffic is shifting, an A/B test shifts only
traffic that matches a particular criterion. A/B tests can end after a certain
amount of time, or they can run until a user explicitly decides it's over.

A common use for A/B testing is to show one subset of users a new look for a UI,
for example, while collecting user feedback. When the UI designers think they
have enough feedback, they can decide whether to roll out the new version to
everyone, or to roll everyone back to the old UI.

In Flagger, A/B tests are also implemented with the Canary resource. Here's the
Canary defined in `apps/faces/faces-canary.yaml` in `gitops-linkerd`:

```yaml
apiVersion: flagger.app/v1beta1
kind: Canary
metadata:
  name: faces-gui
spec:
  provider: nginx
  targetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: faces-gui
  ingressRef:
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Ingress
    name: faces-gui
  progressDeadlineSeconds: 60
  service:
    port: 80
    targetPort: http
  analysis:
    interval: 10s
    threshold: 3
    iterations: 10
    # A/B test routing
    match:
      - headers:
          x-faces-user:
            exact: "testuser"
    metrics:
      - name: request-success-rate
        thresholdRange:
          min: 70
        interval: 1m
    webhooks:
      - name: load-test
        type: rollout
        url: http://flagger-loadtester.flagger-system/
        metadata:
          cmd:
            "hey -z 2m -q 10 -c 2 -H 'x-faces-user: testuser' -host
            faces-gui.faces.sslip.io
            http://ingress-nginx-controller.ingress-nginx"
      - name: load-test-primary
        type: rollout
        url: http://flagger-loadtester.flagger-system/
        metadata:
          cmd:
            "hey -z 2m -q 10 -c 2 -H 'x-faces-user: normaluser' -host
            faces-gui.faces.sslip.io
            http://ingress-nginx-controller.ingress-nginx"
```

Most of this should be familiar by now, but there are definitely some
differences:

- `provider` is `nginx` rather than `linkerd`. For this A/B test, Flagger will
  edit an Ingress resource that's being monitored by NGINX, rather than editing
  an SMI TrafficSplit that's being monitored by Linkerd.

- `ingressRef` specifies which Ingress resource Flagger should manage.

- There's a new `analysis.match` section which describes which traffic to shift.
  In this case, we'll route traffic with the header `x-faces-user: testuser` to
  the B side of the test (the new version).

- This A/B test is time-based: after 10 (`analysis.iterations`) periods of 10
  seconds (`analysis.interval`), the test will be over and the new version will
  be promoted.

  - It's possible to do manual gating with webhooks. This is a bit more
    advanced: see <https://docs.flagger.app/usage/webhooks#manual-gating> for
    more information.

- In `analysis.webhooks`, we supply load to both the A side and the B side.

Worth a note: Flagger can't currently do an A/B test using the `linkerd`
provider. As Linkerd adopts more of the Gateway API, though, this will change!

### Flagger Under the Hood

There is, of course, an enormous amount more that we could discuss about
Flagger. As always, we'll avoid the temptation in most cases, but there are a
few aspects that we should definitely cover to make it easier to understand
what's going on.

First, the way Flagger handles services can be very confusing at first. As an
example, consider a Canary for a Deployment called `face`, with a Service named
`face`:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: face
  namespace: faces
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    service: face
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: http
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: face
  namespace: faces
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      service: face
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        service: face
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: face
        image: dwflynn/faces-service:0.8.0
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        ports:
        - name: http
          containerPort: 8000
        ...
```

1. Flagger needs to understand the selector used by the Deployment to match up
   with its Pods. In our case, since we told Flagger that `service` was in its
   `selectorLabels`, Flagger will find the `service: face` label.

2. Flagger will create a new Deployment named `face-primary`, which will be
   labeled with `service: face-primary`.

3. Flagger will create a new Service named `face-primary`, which will use a
   selector of `service: face-primary`.

4. Flagger will edit the `face` Service to also use a selector of
   `service: face-primary`.

5. Flagger will create a new Service named `face-canary` using a selector of
   `service: face`.

   At this point:

   - Service `face` and Service `face-primary` both select the `face-primary`
     Deployment. This is the original production `face` workload.

   - Service `face-canary` will select the `face` Deployment. This will be the
     canary workload.

6. Flagger will route 100% of `face` traffic to the `face-primary` Service, and
   0% to the `face` Service.

   This means that all traffic for `face` will go to the production workload.

When a Canary becomes active, Flagger will edit the `face` Deployment to have
the canary workload, and gradually start routing traffic to the canary service
using whatever traffic-shifting mechanism is active.

When the Canary completes, Flagger will edit the `face-primary` Deployment to
have the promoted workload, then reset traffic to go 100% to `face-primary` and
0% to `face`.

There are two critical things to bear in mind here:

1. To monitor a Canary while it's in progress, you can use
   `kubectl get canaries` to look at the Canary objects, but you can also use
   Linkerd Viz to directly look at the traffic weighting. Using Linkerd Viz can
   be simpler, especially if you're using the Linkerd Viz dashboard.

2. **Both Deployments and both Services always exist.** Don't be confused by
   this: look at the Canary resources or the traffic split!

### The Biggest Flagger Gotcha Of All

Finally, there is one huge gotcha when working with Flagger. It doesn't have to
be frequent, nor is it that strange when you think about it, but it is **very**
important to understand:

**When a Canary rollout fails, the rollout will be reset but Flagger cannot
change the Git commit that triggered the rollout.**

What this means is that if you start a Flagger rollout by, say, updating the
`face` Deployment from version 1.0.0 of your `image` to version 1.1.0, and that
fails, **your Git repository will still show version 1.1.0, but your cluster
will be running version 1.0.0**. This is not a bug: you do not want Flagger to
be able to edit your Git repository. It is, however, the biggest way in which
the idea that "Git is always true" can break down.

The easiest way to deal with this is dirt simple: watch your rollouts until they
finish, and if they fail, deal with it! Either fix the issue and roll forward,
or push a commit to reflect the version that you're still using.
