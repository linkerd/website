In light of the Open Service Mesh team's announcement that
[OSM will be archived and no further OSM releases will be published](https://openservicemesh.io/blog/osm-project-update/),
the Linkerd team is happy to welcome all Open Service Mesh adopters to the
Linkerd community. Linkerd and OSM have always been philosophical partners,
emphasizing a simple and lightweight approach to the service mesh, and OSM
adopters will feel right at home with Linkerdâ€”the simplest and lightest service
mesh on the market.

OSM adopters who are running on Azure will be happy to know that Linkerd
provides first-class support for Azure and AKS clusters:

- AKS is a fully-supported platform for Linkerd.
- Linkerd is used heavily on AKS in production by companies around the world,
  including
  [Microsoft itself](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/05/10/service-mesh-at-scale-how-xbox-cloud-gaming-secures-22k-pods-with-linkerd%EF%BF%BC/),
  and managed versions are
  [available on the Azure Marketplace](https://buoyant.io/blog/announcing-linkerd-2-13-circuit-breaking-dynamic-request-routing-fips).
- Buoyant, the creators of Linkerd, provides
  [enterprise migration for OSM customers](https://buoyant.io/blog/announcing-enterprise-migration-for-open-service-mesh-customers).

If you are an Open Service Mesh adopter and would like to learn more about how
to transition to Linkerd, please drop a note in
[the Linkerd OSS Slack](https://slack.linkerd.io/)!

The Linkerd team welcomes Open Service Mesh adopters with open arms, and wishes
our friends at the Open Service Mesh project the best of luck in their future
endeavors.
