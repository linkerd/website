In light of the Open Service Mesh team's announcement that [OSM will be archived
and no further OSM releases will be
published](https://openservicemesh.io/blog/osm-project-update/), the Linkerd
team is happy to welcome all Open Service Mesh adopters to the Linkerd
community. Linkerd and OSM have always been philosophical partners, emphasizing
a simple and lightweight approach to the service mesh, and OSM adopters will
feel right at home with Linkerdâ€”the simplest and lightest service mesh on the
market.

OSM adopters on Azure will be happy to know that Linkerd provides first-class
support for Azure and AKS clusters:

* AKS is a fully-supported platform for Linkerd.
* Buoyant, the creators and maintainers of Linkerd, itself powers critical
  production systems on Azure with Linkerd.
* In the [recent Linkerd 2.13
  release](https://buoyant.io/blog/announcing-linkerd-2-13-circuit-breaking-dynamic-request-routing-fips),
  Buoyant also announced an Azure marketplace offering, allowing Azure customers
  to easily introduce a fully managed version of Linkerd into their Azure
  environment.

For enterprise customers, Buoyant has also announced an [enterprise migration
package](https://buoyant.io/blog/announcing-enterprise-migration-for-open-service-mesh-customers)
for existing OSM customers which will allow them to seamlessly migrate to a
managed Linkerd offering.

If you are an Open Service Mesh adopter and would like to learn more about how
to transition to Linkerd, please drop a note in [the Linkerd OSS
Slack](https://slack.linkerd.io/) (for open source) or [contact
Buoyant](https://buoyant.io/contact) (for enterprise).

The Linkerd team welcomes Open Service Mesh adopters with open arms, and wishes
our friends at the Open Service Mesh project the best of luck in their future
endeavors.
