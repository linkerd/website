In light of the Open Service Mesh team's announcement that [OSM will be archived
and no further OSM releases will be
published](https://openservicemesh.io/blog/osm-project-update/), the Linkerd
team is happy to welcome all Open Service Mesh adopters to the Linkerd
community. Linkerd and OSM have always been philosophical partners, emphasizing
a simple and lightweight approach to the service mesh, and OSM adopters will
feel right at home with Linkerd—the simplest and lightest service mesh on the
market.

OSM adopters who are running on Azure will be happy to know that Linkerd
provides first-class support for Azure and AKS clusters:

* AKS is a fully-supported platform for Linkerd.
* Linkerd is used heavily on AKS in production by companies around the world,
  including [Microsoft
  itself](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/05/10/service-mesh-at-scale-how-xbox-cloud-gaming-secures-22k-pods-with-linkerd%EF%BF%BC/),
  and managed versions are [available on the Azure Marketplace](https://buoyant.io/blog/announcing-linkerd-2-13-circuit-breaking-dynamic-request-routing-fips).
* Buoyant, the creators of Linkerd, provides [enterprise migration for OSM
customers](https://buoyant.io/blog/announcing-enterprise-migration-for-open-service-mesh-customers).

If you are an Open Service Mesh adopter and would like to learn more about how
to transition to Linkerd, please drop a note in [the Linkerd OSS
Slack](https://slack.linkerd.io/)!

The Linkerd team welcomes Open Service Mesh adopters with open arms, and wishes
our friends at the Open Service Mesh project the best of luck in their future
endeavors.
