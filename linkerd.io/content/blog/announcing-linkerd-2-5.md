![A helm to end all helms](/uploads/diving-helmet.jpg)

Today we're happy to announce the release of Linkerd 2.5! This release adds
support for installation via [Helm](https://helm.sh/), hardens Linkerd's
`tap` command to obey Kubernetes RBAC rules, improves Linkerd's CLI to report
metrics during traffic splits, allows logging levels to be set dynamically,
and much, much more.

Linkerd's [new Helm support](https://linkerd.io/2/tasks/install-helm/) offers
an alternative to `linkerd install` for installation. If you're a Helm 2 or
Helm 3 user, you can use this install Linkerd with your existing deployment
flow. Even if you're not, this method may provide a better mechanism for
environments that require lots of customization at install time, which would
otherwise require a complicated set of arguments to `linkerd install`. (And
getting a Linkerd 2.x Helm chart into the Helm stable repo itself is [in
progress](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/pull/3292).)

Linkerd's `tap` command provides "tcpdump for microservices" functionality
that allows users to view a sample of live request/response calls for meshed
deployments. (Particularly useful since as of 2.3, Linkerd [encrypts all
meshed HTTP traffic by default]({{< ref "announcing-linkerd-2-3" >}}),
rendering `tcpdump` itself less than useful!) In Linkerd 2.5, `tap` now uses
Kubernetes RBAC to provide granular access to results. This means that
applications which process sensitive data can now control who has access that
data in transit by using the RBAC rules of the underlying Kubernetes cluster.

Linkerd 2.5 also includes a tremendous list of other improvements,
performance enhancements, and bug fixes, including:

* Dynamically configurable proxy logging levels.
* A new `linkerd stat trafficsplits` command to show metrics during traffic
  split operations (e.g. [a canary
  release](https://linkerd.io/2/tasks/canary-release/)).
* A new Kubernetes cluster monitoring Grafana dashboard.
* Handy new CLI flags like `--as` and `--all-namespaces`.
* New pod anti-affinity rules in high availability (HA) mode.
* Namespace-level configuration for auto-injection behavior.

See the [full release notes](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/stable-2.5.0) for details.

If you've been watching the clock, this 2.5 release hits at just under 6
weeks since Linkerd 2.4. This high velocity release cycle is only possible
thanks to the rapidly-growing Linkerd community of contributors, testers, and
adopters. A special thanks especially to
[Jonathan Juares Beber](https://github.com/jonathanbeber),
[Cody Vandermyn](https://github.com/codeman9),
[Alena Varkockova](https://github.com/alenkacz),
[Tarun Pothulapati](https://github.com/Pothulapati)
and Guangming Wang.
