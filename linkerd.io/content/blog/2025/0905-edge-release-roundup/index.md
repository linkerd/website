Welcome to the September 2025 Edge Release Roundup post, where we dive into
the most recent edge releases to help keep everyone up to date on the latest
and greatest! This post covers edge releases from August 2025.

## How to give feedback

Edge releases are a snapshot of our current development work on `main`; by
definition, they always have the most recent features but they may have
incomplete features, features that end up getting rolled back later, or (like
all software) even bugs. That said, edge releases _are_ intended for
production use, and go through a rigorous set of automated and manual tests
before being released. Once released, we also document whether the release is
recommended for broad use -- and when needed, we go back and update the
recommendations.

We would be delighted to hear how these releases work out for you! You can open
[a GitHub issue](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/issues/) or
[discussion](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/discussions/), join us on
[Slack](https://slack.linkerd.io), or visit the
[Buoyant Linkerd Forum](https://linkerd.buoyant.io) -- all are great ways to
reach us.

## Recommendations and breaking changes

All the August edge releases ([edge-25.8.1] through [edge-25.8.5]) are
recommended for everyone, so if you're running an older edge release, now is a
great time to upgrade! This goes double if you're running [edge-25.6.3] or
higher and you're using native sidecars -- there's a fix in [edge-25.8.1] that
you'll definitely want.

As always, we have a couple of breaking changes to note:

* As of [edge-25.8.3], the policy controller is included in the Linkerd
  `controller` image, and we no longer ship a separate `policy-controller`
  image. This should cut down on some image pull traffic, and it means that
  the `policyController.image` Helm value is no longer used.

* As of [edge-25.8.2], we configure routing using the `iptables-nft` command
  by default, rather than with the older `iptables-legacy`. If your nodes
  don't support `iptables-nft`, you can revert to using `iptables-legacy` by
  setting the `iptablesMode` value:

  * If you're using the init container, set `proxyInit.iptablesMode: legacy`
    in the `linkerd2-control-plane` chart.

  * If you're using Linkerd CNI, set `iptablesMode: legacy` in the
    `linkerd2-cni` chart.

* Finally, in [edge-25.8.1], we dropped support for ARMv7 (the 32-bit
  architecture that powered things like the Raspberry Pi 2 and the Beaglebone
  Black). As far as we know, no one is using Linkerd on that architecture  --
  if you are, please let us know!

One other interesting change is that in [edge-25.8.4], the proxy switches to
preferring the post-quantum key exchange algorithm `X25519MLKEM768`. This
shouldn't be a breaking change since we haven't removed support for other
algorithms.

[edge-25.8.5]: https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/edge-25.8.5
[edge-25.8.4]: https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/edge-25.8.4
[edge-25.8.3]: https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/edge-25.8.3
[edge-25.8.2]: https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/edge-25.8.2
[edge-25.8.1]: https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/edge-25.8.1
[edge-25.6.3]: https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/edge-25.6.3

## The releases

As always, each edge release includes _many_ dependency updates which we won't
list here. You can find them in the full release notes for each release.

### edge-25.8.5 (August 27, 2025)

This release adds timeout and gateway error metrics to `linkerd multicluster
check`, to better validate multicluster functionality.

### edge-25.8.4 (August 22, 2025)

This release supports setting `proxy.securityContext` and
the `linkerd-proxy` container, and the `network-validator` container,
respectively. It also switches the proxy to prefer post-quantum key exchange
algorithm `X25519MLKEM768`.

### edge-25.8.3 (August 14, 2025)

This release eliminates the separate `policy-controller` image, instead
including the policy controller in the main `controller` image. This means
that the `policyController.image` Helm value is now ignored. It also adds a
new `rustls_info` metric to make visible which cryptographic provider and
algorithms are in use.

### edge-25.8.2 (August 07, 2025)

This release switches the default command for programming the routing table
from `iptables-legacy` to `iptables-nft`.

### edge-25.8.1 (August 01, 2025)

This release fixes an issue ([#14289]) introduced in [edge-25.6.3] where
native-sidecar proxies would land in an error state after the main container
exited. It also correctly sets `app.kubernetes.io/version` label to list
`linkerd/cli` instead of `linkerd/helm` when installing a Linkerd extension
using the CLI, and it removes support for ARMv7, notably including 32-bit
Raspberry Pi platforms.

## Installing the latest edge release

Installing the latest edge release needs just a single command.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://run.linkerd.io/install-edge | sh
```

You can also
[install edge releases with Helm](/2/tasks/install-helm/).
