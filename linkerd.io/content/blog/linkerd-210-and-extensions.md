Linkerd is the smallest, simplest service mesh in the world. Since Linkerd 2.0,
we've followed a philosophy of minimalism, composability, and building on top
of the existing ecosystem. Doubling down on this idea might seem a little
crazy, but in this blog post I'll describe a feature of the upcoming Linkerd
2.10 release that will make Linkerd _even_ smaller and simpler: _extensions_.

In Linkerd 2.10, we've stripped down Linkerd's default control plane install to
a bare-bones deployment, without the Prometheus, Grafana, dashboard, and other
non-critical components that previously shipped by default. Thanks to these
changes, a basic Linkerd control plane now weighs in at under 200mb at startup,
down from ~500mb in Linkerd 2.9.

Those components are instead now available as an opt-in _extension_, along with
several other components that are not strictly necessary for basic operation.
The initial set of Linkerd extensions includes:

* **viz**, which will contain all the on-cluster metrics stack: Prometheus,
  Grafana, the dashboard, etc.;
* **multicluster**, which will contain all the machinery for cross-cluster
  communication; and
* **jaeger**, which will contain the distributed tracing collector and UI.

Using extensions serves two purposes. First, it allows Linkerd adopters to
choose exactly which bits and pieces of Linkerd they want to install on their
cluster. Second, it allows the Linkerd community to build Linkerd-specific
operators and controllers without having to modify the core Linkerd CLI. More
on that below.

## How does it work?

Installing an extension is just as easy as you'd expect. For example, to
install the **viz** extension, you would run:

```bash
linkerd install -f - | kubectl apply - # install the core control plane
linkerd viz install -f - | kubectl apply - # install the viz extension
```

(For Helm users, each extension will have a corresponding Helm chart.)

We've also made it as easy as possible for third-party extensions to hook into
the same system. For example, calls `linkerd foo` will automatically invoke and
pass arugments to a `linkerd-foo` binary, if found in the user's search path.
Furthermore, after installation, `linkerd check` will automatically run the
checks for all installed extensions and concatenate the output into one report.

Regardless of source, extensions should "feel" just like the rest of Linkerd.

## Why do this?

As Linkerd adoption continues to grow dramatically, so does the set of use
cases it must handle. For some users, out-of-the-box observability is the key
reason they adopted Linkerd. For others, it's secure, cross-cluster
communication. For still others it's Linkerd's transparent, on-by-default mTLS.
This variety of use cases is great to see, but it also places stress on the
projectâ€”especially with our focus on simplicity.

Thus far, we've tackled this in a somewhat ad-hoc manner, including a custom
install flow for the multi-cluster components, a specialized "[Bring Your Own
Prometheus](https://linkerd.io/2/tasks/external-prometheus/)" feature, and so
on. Moving all this machinery to the extensions framework allows for
consistency: each of these feature extensions can now be treated exactly the
same way.

Finally, we're excited about the idea of allowing features in Linkerd that feel
just like the rest of Linkerd but don't require modifying the core project.

## Whither 2.10?

The Linkerd 2.10 release should be live later this week, and will include a ton
of other exciting features, most notably _opaque ports_&mdash;see the writeup
by Charles Pretzer on [Protocol Detection and Opaque Ports in
Linkerd](/2021/02/23/protocol-detection-and-opaque-ports-in-linkerd/) for the
exciting details.

Want to give extensions a shot today? You can try them in the [latest edge
release](https://linkerd.io/2/edge/). Want to build an extension? We'll be
releasing proper documentation shortly after the 2.10 release, but in the
meantime you can [crib from an existing
one](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/tree/main/jaeger).
