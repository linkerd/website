Welcome to the July 2024 Edge Release Roundup post, where we dive into the
most recent edge releases to help keep everyone up to date on the latest and
greatest!

## How to give feedback

Remember, edge releases are a snapshot of our current development work on
`main`; by definition, they always have the most recent features but they may
have incomplete features, features that end up getting rolled back later, or
(like all software) even bugs. That said, edge releases *are* intended for
production use, and go through a rigorous set of automated and manual tests
before being released.

We would be delighted to hear how these releases work out for you! You can
open [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/issues/) or
[discussion](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/discussions/), join us on
[Slack](https://slack.linkerd.io), or visit the [Buoyant Linkerd
Forum](https://linkerd.buoyant.io) -- all are great ways to reach us.

## Community contributions

We couldn't do what we do without the Linkerd community, and this batch of
releases is definitely no exception. Huge thanks to [Adrian Callejas] and
[John Howard] for their contributions! You'll find more information about all
of these contributions in the release-by-release details below.

## Recommendations and breaking changes

All these releases are recommended for general use, but there are two breaking
changes:

- First, as of `edge-24.6.2`, we change the proxy's `/shutdown` endpoint to
  disabled by default. If you want to reenable it, you'll need to set
  `proxy.enableShutdownEndpoint` to `true` on installation or upgrade.

- Second, as of `edge-24.6.4`, it's no longer possible - or necessary! - to
  explicitly set the resource requests for `proxy-init`. There's more
  information on this in the section for `edge-24.6.4`.

## The releases

We've mostly been fixing bugs in these edge releases. Of course, each edge
release has _many_ dependency updates; we won't list them all here, but you
can find them in the release notes for each release.

### [`edge-24.6.4`](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/edge-24.6.4) (June 27, 2024)

This release changes the proxy-init container to always request the same
amount of memory and CPU as the proxy itself, and removes the ability to
explicitly set proxy-init's requests because there's now no need to do so.
(This doesn't increase the resources required for the pod as a
whole, because the proxy-init container completes before the proxy
starts, letting the proxy reuse resources requested by the proxy-init
container. For full details, check out [issue #11320][comment]).

[comment]: https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/issues/11320#issuecomment-2186383081

It also continues work on upcoming GRPCRoute support. Finally, if
`proxy.logHTTPHeaders` is somehow empty, it correctly defaults to "off".

### [`edge-24.6.3`](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/edge-24.6.3) (June 20, 2024)

`edge-24.6.3` adds the `linkerd.io/control-plane-ns` label to the
`ext-namespace-metadata-linkerd-config` Role, for parity with the other
resources created when installing Linkerd.

### [`edge-24.6.2`](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/edge-24.6.2) (June 14, 2024)

Starting in this release, the proxy's `/shutdown` endpoint is disabled by default. It can be reenabled by setting `proxy.enableShutdownEndpoint` to `true` when installing or upgrading. Beyond that, `edge-24.6.2` fixes several bugs: EndpointSlices with no `hostname` field are supported (thanks, [Adrian Callejas]!), DNS resolution errors are correctly logged (and the resolver's log level can be configured), the proxy's administration endpoints function correctly on systems using IPv4-mapped IPv6, and the init container and CNI plugin will not attempt to start on systems that configure IPv6 but don't support `ip6tables`. Finally, it supports controlling whether or not HTTP headers are logged in debug output (with the default being "not"), JSON output for the link, unlink, allow, and allow-scrapes CLI commands, and fixes a typo in the output of  `linkerd diagnostics` (thanks, [John Howard]!)

### [`edge-24.6.1`](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/edge-24.6.1) (June 10, 2024)

This release adds support for JSON output to `linkerd install` and related commands.

## Installing the latest edge release

Installing the latest edge release needs just a single command.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://run.linkerd.io/install-edge | sh
```

You can also [install edge releases with Helm](https://linkerd.io/2.15/tasks/install-helm/).
