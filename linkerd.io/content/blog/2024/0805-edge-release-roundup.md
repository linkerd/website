Welcome to the August 2024 Edge Release Roundup post, where we dive into the
most recent edge releases to help keep everyone up to date on the latest and
greatest!

## How to give feedback

Edge releases are a snapshot of our current development work on `main`; by
definition, they always have the most recent features but they may have
incomplete features, features that end up getting rolled back later, or (like
all software) even bugs. That said, edge releases *are* intended for
production use, and go through a rigorous set of automated and manual tests
before being released.

We would be delighted to hear how these releases work out for you! You can
open [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/issues/) or
[discussion](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/discussions/), join us on
[Slack](https://slack.linkerd.io), or visit the [Buoyant Linkerd
Forum](https://linkerd.buoyant.io) -- all are great ways to reach us.

## Community contributions

We couldn't do what we do without the Linkerd community, and this batch of
releases is definitely no exception. Huge thanks to [@djryanj] for his
contributions! You'll find more information about all of these contributions
in the release-by-release details below.

## Recommendations and breaking changes

All these releases are recommended for general use. Happily, there are no
breaking changes here.

## The releases

The big story for this month is definitely `edge-24.7.5`: this massive release
brings together a lot of threads of work to provide us the bones of the
upcoming Linkerd 2.16 release. Of course, each edge release has bugfixes and
_many_ dependency updates; we won't list them all here, but you can find them
in the release notes for each release.

### [`edge-24.7.5`](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/edge-24.7.5) (July 26, 2024)

This release supports Server-scoped default policy, policy audit mode,
GRPCRoute, and new retry and timeout configuration (including for Gateway API
resources). There's a lot to unpack here:

* **Server-scoped default policy**: you can use the new `accessPolicy` field
  of a Server to override the default inbound policy for that Server. The
  default is `deny`, for backward compatibility.

* **Policy audit mode**: setting the default inbound policy or a Server's
  `accessPolicy` to `audit` allows traffic to flow, but logs anything that
  would be denied.

* **GRPCRoute**: this release includes support for the Gateway API GRPCRoute.
  Remember to set `enableHttpRoutes` to `false` when installing if you don't
  want Linkerd to manage the Gateway API CRDs for you!

* **New retry and timeout configuration**: you can now configure retries and
  timeouts with annotations on Service, HTTPRoute, or GRPCRoute resources,
  with HTTPRoute and GRPCRoute taking precedence over Service if there are
  overlaps. Note that these are _counted_ retries, rather than the _budgeted_
  retries provided when you configure retries in a Server: you will configure
  a maximum number of retries rather than a percentage of retries.

### [`edge-24.7.4`](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/edge-24.7.4) (July 25, 2024)

This release correctly supports IPv6 in the Linkerd CNI `network-validator`
and `repair-controller` containers.

### [`edge-24.7.3`](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/edge-24.7.3) (July 19, 2024)

This release updates the documentation on what `networkValidator.connectAddr`
in the Helm chart means (thanks, [@djryanj]!).

### [`edge-24.7.2`](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/edge-24.7.2) (July 15, 2024)

This release bumps dependencies but has no functional changes from `edge-24.7.1`.

### [`edge-24.7.1`](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/edge-24.7.1) (July 4, 2024)

This release removes the empty `shortnames` fields from the ExternalWorkload CRD.

## Installing the latest edge release

Installing the latest edge release needs just a single command.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://run.linkerd.io/install-edge | sh
```

You can also [install edge releases with Helm](https://linkerd.io/2.15/tasks/install-helm/).
