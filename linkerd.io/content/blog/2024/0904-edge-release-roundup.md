Welcome to the September 2024 Edge Release Roundup post, where we dive into the
most recent edge releases to help keep everyone up to date on the latest and
greatest!

## How to give feedback

Edge releases are a snapshot of our current development work on `main`; by
definition, they always have the most recent features but they may have
incomplete features, features that end up getting rolled back later, or (like
all software) even bugs. That said, edge releases *are* intended for
production use, and go through a rigorous set of automated and manual tests
before being released.

We would be delighted to hear how these releases work out for you! You can
open [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/issues/) or
[discussion](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/discussions/), join us on
[Slack](https://slack.linkerd.io), or visit the [Buoyant Linkerd
Forum](https://linkerd.buoyant.io) -- all are great ways to reach us.

## Community contributions

We couldn't do what we do without the Linkerd community, and this batch of
releases is definitely no exception. Huge thanks to [@mozemke] for their
contributions! You'll find more information about all of these contributions
in the release-by-release details below.

## Recommendations and breaking changes

All these releases are recommended for general use. Happily, there are no
breaking changes here.

## The releases

August's edge releases look small, but [`edge-24.8.1`] and [`edge-24.8.2`]
provided the finishing touches for [Linkerd 2.16], which shipped on August
13! Of course, each edge release has bugfixes and _many_ dependency updates;
we won't list them all here, but you can find them in the release notes for
each release.

One thing to be aware of here: as of [`edge-24.8.1`], the GRPCRoute CRD is
_optional_; if you don't install it before installing Linkerd, Linkerd will
run without GRPCRoute support, and you'll need to restart the Linkerd control
plane if you add the GRPCRoute CRD after installing Linkerd.

[`edge-24.8.1`]: https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/edge-24.8.1
[`edge-24.8.2`]: https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/edge-24.8.2
[Linkerd 2.16]: https://linkerd.io/2024/08/13/announcing-linkerd-2.16/index.html

### [`edge-24.8.3`](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/edge-24.8.3) (August 29, 2024)

This release starts the Linkerd 2.17 development cycle, with two fixes for
Linkerd Viz: it correctly supports setting the group ID using the
`linkerd-viz` Helm chart (thanks, @mozemke!) and it cleans up font downloading
to avoid WAF errors.

### [`edge-24.8.2`](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/edge-24.8.2) (August 5, 2024)

This final touch for Linkerd 2.16 makes certain that Linkerd won't attempt to
bind to IPv6 addresses at all unless IPv6 is enabled.

### [`edge-24.8.1`](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/edge-24.8.1) (August 2, 2024)

This release makes GRPCRoute optional: if you don't have the GRPCRoute CRD
installed when Linkerd starts, Linkerd will run without any GRPCRoute
functionality rather than failing to start. (If you add the GRPCRoute CRD after Linkerd is running, you'll need to restart the Linkerd control plane to enable GRPCRoute support.)

[`edge-24.8.1`] also improves the  `status` text when an HTTPRoute is
incorrectly configured with `parentRef` pointing to a headless service, to
make this situation easier to debug, and makes certain that trace-level logs
honor `proxy.logHTTPHeaders`.

## Installing the latest edge release

Installing the latest edge release needs just a single command.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://run.linkerd.io/install-edge | sh
```

You can also [install edge releases with Helm](https://linkerd.io/2.15/tasks/install-helm/).
