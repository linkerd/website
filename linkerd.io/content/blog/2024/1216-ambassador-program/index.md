We’re excited to announce the
[**Linkerd Ambassador Program 2.0**](/community/ambassadors-apply/)! This
revamped program builds on everything that made the original a success, with
even more ways for you to get involved, make an impact, and help shape the
future of the Linkerd community. Whether you're an original supporter or new to
the Linkerd family, the new Ambassador Program is packed with enhanced perks,
expanded opportunities, and fresh ways to connect and collaborate. If you're
ready to stand up for simplicity and lead the charge, this is your chance!

In a world where Kubernetes complexity has become the norm, **Linkerd stands
apart**. We’ve always championed simplicity—not as a compromise, but as a _core
value_. Now, we’re inviting YOU to be a part of this mission.

The brand-new **Linkerd Ambassador Program** is your chance to join a community
of like-minded champions who believe in the power of simplicity, who reject
unnecessary complexity, and who want to make Kubernetes better for everyone.

Are you ready to stand up for simplicity and help spread the word? Let’s do this
together.

## Who Is This Program For?

The Linkerd Ambassador Program is designed for those who believe in the
importance of keeping it simple in an already overly complex cloud native
ecosystem. If you:

- Believe that Kubernetes doesn’t have to be daunting,
- Are passionate about educating others,
- Want to challenge the status quo and advocate for better, developer-friendly
  platforms, this program is for you.

Whether you’re a seasoned Linkerd expert or someone who’s just starting out but
feels strongly about Linkerd’s mission, you’ll find a place here.

## What Do Linkerd Ambassadors Do?

Linkerd Ambassadors are the voice of our community, spreading the message of
simplicity and empowering others to embrace it. Every Ambassador contributes in
their own way:

- **Educate:** Give talks, write blog posts, create videos, host meetups, and
  answer questions in the Linkerd Slack.
- **Foster Collaboration:** Build strong relationships and encourage
  contributions.
- **Grow the Community:** Onboard new users and help them understand the power
  of Linkerd.
- **Provide Feedback:** Share community insights and suggestions with the
  maintainers to keep improving Linkerd.
- **Promote Globally:** Amplify Linkerd’s message to a wider audience.

No matter your style—whether you prefer creating content, mentoring newcomers,
or leading local meetups—there’s a way for you to make an impact.

## Why Become a Linkerd Ambassador?

We know you’re not doing it for the swag (but we have that, too!). Becoming a
Linkerd Ambassador comes with an array of perks:

- **Exclusive Swag:** Get custom Linkerd Ambassador gear.
- **Recognition:** Earn your badge on LinkedIn, be featured on the Linkerd
  Ambassador page, and get a spotlight on our website.
- **Events:** Enjoy special Ambassador gatherings at KubeCon and beyond.
- **Support:** Access funding, training, and resources for your
  initiatives—whether it’s hosting workshops, speaking at events, or creating
  content.
- **Networking:** Join regular Ambassador-only meetings, connect with other
  cloud-native experts, and build lasting relationships.

Most importantly, you’ll be at the heart of the Linkerd mission, helping to
shape the future of Kubernetes platforms.

## Ready to Make an Impact?

If you’re passionate about simplicity, Linkerd, and community, we want to hear
from you. This is your chance to stand out, give back, and be part of something
transformative.

wait to see what you’ll bring to the Linkerd community. Together, let’s make
simplicity the standard for Kubernetes.
