Welcome to the June 2024 Edge Release Roundup post, where we dive into the
most recent edge releases to help keep everyone up to date on the latest and
greatest!

## How to give feedback

Remember, edge releases are a snapshot of our current development work on
`main`; by definition, they always have the most recent features but they may
have incomplete features, features that end up getting rolled back later, or
(like all software) even bugs. That said, edge releases *are* intended for
production use, and go through a rigorous set of automated and manual tests
before being released.

We would be delighted to hear how these releases work out for you! You can
open [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/issues/) or
[discussion](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/discussions/), join us on
[Slack](https://slack.linkerd.io), or visit the [Buoyant Linkerd
Forum](https://linkerd.buoyant.io) -- all are great ways to reach us.

## Community contributions

We couldn't do what we do without the Linkerd community, and this batch of
releases is definitely no exception. Huge thanks to [knowmost], [Marwan
Ahmed], and [Nico Feulner] for their contributions! You'll find more
information about all of these contributions in the release-by-release details
below.

## Recommendations and breaking changes

We recommend `edge-24.5.5` for anyone considering an `edge-24.5.*` release; it
has important fixes for the Linkerd CNI plugin on GKE. `edge-24.5.1` is
specifically **not** recommended for users of GKE, due to a bug with the
default Linkerd configuration in that release.

Starting in `edge-24.5.1`, the `patchs` metric introduced in `edge-24.3.4` is
renamed to `patches`.

Finally, starting in `edge-24.5.2`, Linkerd will install the GRPCRoute CRD in
the `gateway.networking.k8s.io` API group, in preparation for later GRPCRoute
support. (You can disable this by setting `enableHttpRoutes` to `false` when
installing, which will also prevent Linkerd from installing the HTTPRoute CRD
in the `gateway.networking.k8s.io` API group.)

## The releases

This group of releases has focused on IPv6 support - delivered in
`edge-24.5.2`! - and finalizing fixes for some edge cases in the way Linkerd
handles EndpointSlices and HTTPRoutes. Of course, each edge release has _many_
dependency updates; we won't list them all here, but you can find them in the
release notes for each release.

### [`edge-24.5.5`](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/edge-24.5.5) (May 31, 2024)

This release switches IPv6 off by default for the entire control plane,
including the Linkerd CNI plugin. Set `disableIPv6` to `false` to enable IPv6.

### [`edge-24.5.4`](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/edge-24.5.4) (May 23, 2024)

_We recommend [`edge-24.5.5`] instead of this release. In this release, IPv6
support is off by default for most of the control plane, but it is mistakenly
on by default for the Linkerd CNI plugin._

This release adds support for JSON output to the `linkerd inject`, `linkerd
uninject` and `linkerd profile` commands, and a `--token` flag to `linkerd
diagnostics policy` that allows specifying the context token to use so that
you can see how specific clients will see policies. It also adds support for
setting the group ID for the control plane (thanks, [Nico Feulner]!), switches
IPv6 to off by default for the control plane, adds support for several proxy
settings to the `linkerd-control-plane` chart, allows overriding how many
cores control-plane components can use, correctly supports Gateway API
producer routes, fixes a race conditions around EndpointSlice updates, and
fixes intermittent routing failures with HTTPRoute ([issue 12610]).

### [`edge-24.5.3`](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/edge-24.5.3) (May 15, 2024)

_If you use the Linkerd CNI plugin on GKE, you will need to disable IPv6 or
use [`edge-24.5.5`] instead._

This release removes an internal limit on the number of concurrent gRPC
streams to the control plane, leaving available memory as the only constraint.

### [`edge-24.5.2`](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/edge-24.5.2) (May 13, 2024)

_If you use the Linkerd CNI plugin on GKE, you will need to disable IPv6 or
use [`edge-24.5.5`] instead._

This release adds support for IPv6. It defaults to enabled: set `disableIPv6`
to `true` when installing to disable it. It also correctly sets the
`backend_not_found` status on HTTPRoutes with no backends. Finally, it adds
the Gateway API GRPCRoute resource (in the `gateway.networking.k8s.io` API
group) as part of continued work on support for GRPCRoutes, although this edge
release doesn't attach any functionality to the CRD.

To prevent Linkerd from installing any CRDs into `gateway.networking.k8s.io`,
set `enableHttpRoutes` to `false` when installing.

### [`edge-24.5.1`](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/edge-24.5.1) (May 2, 2024)

_We recommend [`edge-24.5.5`] instead of this release due to a bug that
prevents Linkerd from functioning on GKE with the default configuration.
Additionally, this release has one breaking change: the `patchs` metric
introduced in [`edge-24.3.4`] is now correctly named `patches`._

This release adds configurable HTTP/2 server keepalives, fixes CLI issues and
opaque-port issues when using native sidecars ([issue #12395]), restores
Server v1beta1 to ease migrations after it was mistakenly removed in
[`edge-24.1.2`], fixes an issue that could cause the endpoints gauge to report
incorrect numbers of endpoints, and continues ongoing work on upcoming IPv6
support.

Additionally, it avoids unnecessary cleanup of headless endpoint mirrors
during garbage collection (thanks, [Marwan Ahmed]!) and cleans up some
documentation in the code (thanks, [knowmost]!).
