We were really excited to have Linkerd 2.0 featured on this week's [TGIK](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjQU5ZI2mHswy7OOsii_URg). It was even DDOS'd live on screen! (It held up fine, of course.)

In this episode, Joe takes Linkerd 2.0 out for a spin, covering:

- Installation (including YAML-spelunking)
- How Linkerd interacts with Kubernetes
- Design philosophy behind the project
