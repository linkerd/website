Linkerd momentum was at an all-time high at last week's KubeCon EU! This was
the biggest Kubecon yet, with 7,500+ attendees, over 200 talks, and a huge
amount of Linkerd momentum. Here's a quick recap of most of the Linkerd news.

## Linkerd Benchmarks

On Saturday, the folks at [Kinvolk](https://kinvolk.io) published their
[Linkerd Benchmarks](https://linkerd.io/2019/05/18/linkerd-benchmarks/),
comparing Linkerd, Istio, and bare metal, and showing you the resource cost of
adding the service mesh to your infrastructure. The results may or may not
surprise you.

## Microsoft and Linkerd

On Tuesday, Microsoft announced the [Service Mesh
Interface](https://smi-spec.io), a specification that exposes core service mesh
features like telemetry, traffic shifting, and policy via Kubernetes primitives.
[Linkerd was a major part of the SMI
launch](https://linkerd.io/2019/05/24/linkerd-and-smi/), and we're excited about
the opportunities this opens up for us, especially around integrations like
[Kiali](https://www.kiali.io/),
[Flagger](https://github.com/weaveworks/flagger), and
[Kubecost](https://kubecost.com/)!

On Wednesday, the VSCode team launched a [Linkerd VSCode plugin][vscode],
adding cool Linkerd functionality to your local VSCode editor! (See the [talk
here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOvpMfunD4s#t=20m01s).)

## DigitalOcean and Linkerd

Right in the middle of Kubecon, Digital Ocean's Kubernetes Service officially
[went to GA (General Availability)](https://blog.digitalocean.com/doks-in-ga/),
with a little hidden feature in the UI:

## OpenFaaS integration

One of the exciting hot topics at the conference was the
[OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com/) Linkerd integration, allowing OpenFaaS
users to automatically encrypt communication between functions! (You can read
[the full guide
here](https://github.com/openfaas-incubator/openfaas-linkerd2).)

## And, of course, lots and lots of talks!

As always, there was a long list of Linkerd talks at Kubecon If you couldn't
make the conference in person, never fear, the recordings are already live.
