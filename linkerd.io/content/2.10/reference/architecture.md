At a high level, Linkerd consists of a *control plane* and a *data plane*.

The *control plane* is a set of services that run in a dedicated
namespace. These services accomplish various things---aggregating telemetry
data, providing a user-facing API, providing control data to the data plane
proxies, etc. Together, they drive the behavior of the data plane.

The *data plane* consists of transparent proxies that are run next
to each service instance. These proxies automatically handle all traffic to and
from the service. Because they're transparent, these proxies act as highly
instrumented out-of-process network stacks, sending telemetry to, and receiving
control signals from, the control plane.

## Control Plane

The Linkerd control plane is a set of services that run in a dedicated
Kubernetes namespace (`linkerd` by default). These services accomplish various
things---aggregating telemetry data, providing a user-facing API, providing
control data to the data plane proxies, etc. Together, they drive the behavior
of the data plane. To install the control plane on your own cluster, follow the [instructions](/2/tasks/install/).

The control plane is made up of:

### Controller

The controller deployment consists of the public-api container that provides an
API for the CLI and dashboard to interface with.

### Destination

Each [proxy](#proxy) in the data plane uses this component to lookup where to
send requests. The destination deployment is also used to fetch service profile
information used for per-route metrics, retries and timeouts.

### Identity

This component provides a [Certificate
Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority) that accepts
[CSRs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_signing_request) from proxies
and returns certificates signed with the correct identity. These certificates
are fetched by the proxy on start and must be issued before the proxy becomes
ready. They are subsequently used for any connection between Linkerd proxies to
implement mTLS.

### Proxy Injector

The injector is an [admission controller][admission-controller], which receives
a webhook request every time a pod is created. This injector inspects resources
for a Linkerd-specific annotation (`linkerd.io/inject: enabled`). When that
annotation exists, the injector mutates the pod's specification and adds both an
`initContainer` as well as a sidecar containing the proxy itself.

### Service Profile Validator

The validator is also an [admission controller][admission-controller], which
validates new [service profiles](/2/reference/service-profiles/) before they are
saved.

### Tap

The tap deployment receives requests from the CLI and dashboard to watch
requests and responses in real time. It establishes stream to watch these
requests and responses in specific proxies associated with the requested
applications.

### Web

The web deployment provides the Linkerd dashboard. This does not require running
`linkerd dashboard` and can be [exposed](/2/tasks/exposing-dashboard/) to
others.

### Heartbeat

This CronJob runs once a day and records some analytics that help with the
development of Linkerd. It is optional and can be disabled.

### Grafana

Linkerd comes with many dashboards out of the box. The Grafana component is used
to render and display these dashboards. You can reach these dashboards via links
in the Linkerd dashboard itself. It is possible to see high level metrics and dig
down into the details for your workloads as well as Linkerd itself.

The dashboards that are provided out of the box include:

### Prometheus

Prometheus is a cloud native monitoring solution that is used to collect and
store all of the Linkerd metrics. It is installed as part of the control plane
and provides the data used by the CLI, dashboard and Grafana.

The proxy exposes a `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus to scrape on port 4191.
This is scraped every 10 seconds. These metrics are then available to all the
other Linkerd components, such as the CLI and dashboard.

## Data Plane

The Linkerd data plane is comprised of lightweight proxies, which are deployed
as sidecar containers alongside each instance of your service code. In order to
"add" a service to the Linkerd service mesh, the pods for that service must be
redeployed to include a data plane proxy in each pod. The proxy injector
accomplishes this by watching for a specific annotation that can either be added
with `linkerd inject` or by hand to the pod's spec.  You can [add your
service](/2/tasks/adding-your-service/) to the data plane with a single CLI
command.

These proxies transparently intercept communication to and from each pod by
utilizing iptables rules that are automatically configured by
[linkerd-init](#linkerd-init), and add features such as instrumentation and
encryption (TLS), as well as allowing and denying requests according to the
relevant policy.

These proxies are not designed to be configured by hand. Rather, their behavior
is driven by the control plane.

### Proxy

An ultralight transparent proxy written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/),
the proxy is installed into each pod of a service and becomes part of the data
plane. It receives all incoming traffic for a pod and intercepts all outgoing
traffic via an `initContainer` that configures `iptables` to forward the
traffic correctly. Because it is a sidecar and intercepts all the incoming and
outgoing traffic for a service, there are no code changes required and it can
even be added to a running service.

The proxy's features include:

- Transparent, zero-config proxying for HTTP, HTTP/2, and arbitrary TCP
  protocols.

- Automatic Prometheus metrics export for HTTP and TCP traffic.

- Transparent, zero-config WebSocket proxying.

- Automatic, latency-aware, layer-7 load balancing.

- Automatic layer-4 load balancing for non-HTTP traffic.

- Automatic TLS.

- An on-demand diagnostic tap API.

The proxy supports service discovery via DNS and the
[destination gRPC API](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2-proxy-api).

### Linkerd Init

To make the proxy truly transparent, traffic needs to be automatically routed
through it. The `linkerd-init` container is added as a Kubernetes
[init container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/)
that runs before any other containers are started. This executes a small
[program](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2-proxy-init) which executes
`iptables` and configures the flow of traffic.

There are two main rules that `iptables` uses:

- Any traffic being sent to the pod's external IP address (10.0.0.1 for example)
  is forwarded to a specific port on the proxy (4143). By setting
  `SO_ORIGINAL_DST` on the socket, the proxy is able to forward the traffic to the
  original destination port that your application is listening on.

- Any traffic originating from within the pod and being sent to an external IP
  address (not 127.0.0.1) is forwarded to a specific port on the proxy (4140).
  Because `SO_ORIGINAL_DST` was set on the socket, the proxy is able to forward
  the traffic to the original recipient (unless there is a reason to send it
  elsewhere). This does not result in a traffic loop because the `iptables`
  rules explicitly skip the proxy's UID.

{{< note >}}
By default, most ports are forwarded through the proxy. This is not always
desirable and it is possible to have specific ports skip the proxy entirely for
both incoming and outgoing traffic. See the [protocol
detection](/2/features/protocol-detection/) documentation for an explanation of
what's happening here.

## CLI

The Linkerd CLI is run locally on your machine and is used to interact with the
control and data planes. It can be used to view statistics, debug production
issues in real time and install/upgrade the control and data planes.

## Dashboard

The Linkerd dashboard provides a high level view of what is happening with your
services in real time. It can be used to view the "golden" metrics (success
rate, requests/second and latency), visualize service dependencies and
understand the health of specific service routes. One way to pull it up is by
running `linkerd dashboard` from the command line.

{{< fig src="/images/architecture/stat.png" title="Top Line Metrics">}}

{{< note >}}
The dashboard is served by `linkerd-web` and does not require running `linkerd
dashboard`. It can be [exposed](/2/tasks/exposing-dashboard/) to others.
