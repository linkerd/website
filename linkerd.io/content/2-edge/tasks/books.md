This demo is of a Ruby application that helps you manage your bookshelf. It
consists of multiple microservices and uses JSON over HTTP to communicate with
the other services. There are three services:

- [webapp](https://github.com/BuoyantIO/booksapp/blob/master/webapp.rb): the
  frontend

- [authors](https://github.com/BuoyantIO/booksapp/blob/master/authors.rb): an
  API to manage the authors in the system

- [books](https://github.com/BuoyantIO/booksapp/blob/master/books.rb): an API
  to manage the books in the system

For demo purposes, the app comes with a simple traffic generator. The overall
topology looks like this:

{{< fig src="/images/books/topology.png" title="Topology" >}}

## Prerequisites

To use this guide, you'll need to have Linkerd installed on your cluster.
Follow the [Installing Linkerd Guide](../install/) if you haven't already done
this.

## Install the app

To get started, let's install the books app onto your cluster. In your local
terminal, run:

```bash
kubectl create ns booksapp && \
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://run.linkerd.io/booksapp.yml \
  | kubectl -n booksapp apply -f -
```

This command creates a namespace for the demo, downloads its Kubernetes
resource manifest and uses `kubectl` to apply it to your cluster. The app
comprises the Kubernetes deployments and services that run in the `booksapp`
namespace.

Downloading a bunch of containers for the first time takes a little while.
Kubernetes can tell you when all the services are running and ready for
traffic. Wait for that to happen by running:

```bash
kubectl -n booksapp rollout status deploy webapp
```

You can also take a quick look at all the components that were added to your
cluster by running:

```bash
kubectl -n booksapp get all
```

Once the rollout has completed successfully, you can access the app itself by
port-forwarding `webapp` locally:

```bash
kubectl -n booksapp port-forward svc/webapp 7000 >/dev/null &
```

(We redirect to `/dev/null` just so you don't get flooded with "Handling
connection" messages for the rest of the exercise.)

Open [http://localhost:7000/](http://localhost:7000/) in your browser to see the
frontend.

{{< fig src="/images/books/frontend.png" title="Frontend" >}}

Unfortunately, there is an error in the app: if you click *Add Book*, it will
fail 50% of the time. This is a classic case of non-obvious, intermittent
failure---the type that drives service owners mad because it is so difficult to
debug. Kubernetes itself cannot detect or surface this error. From Kubernetes's
perspective, it looks like everything's fine, but you know the application is
returning errors.

{{< fig src="/images/books/failure.png" title="Failure" >}}

## Add Linkerd to the service

Now we need to add the Linkerd data plane proxies to the service. The easiest
option is to do something like this:

```bash
kubectl get -n booksapp deploy -o yaml \
  | linkerd inject - \
  | kubectl apply -f -
```

This command retrieves the manifest of all deployments in the `booksapp`
namespace, runs them through `linkerd inject`, and then re-applies with
`kubectl apply`. The `linkerd inject` command annotates each resource to
specify that they should have the Linkerd data plane proxies added, and
Kubernetes does this when the manifest is reapplied to the cluster. Best of
all, since Kubernetes does a rolling deploy, the application stays running the
entire time. (See [Automatic Proxy Injection](../../features/proxy-injection/) for
more details on how this works.)

## Debugging

Let's use Linkerd to discover the root cause of this app's failures. We can use
the `stat-inbound` command to see the success rate of the webapp deployment:

```bash
linkerd viz -n booksapp stat-inbound deploy/webapp
NAME    SERVER          ROUTE      TYPE  SUCCESS   RPS  LATENCY_P50  LATENCY_P95  LATENCY_P99  
webapp  [default]:4191  [default]        100.00%  0.30          4ms          9ms         10ms  
webapp  [default]:4191  probe            100.00%  0.60          0ms          1ms          1ms  
webapp  [default]:7000  probe            100.00%  0.30          2ms          2ms          2ms  
webapp  [default]:7000  [default]         75.66%  8.22         18ms         65ms         93ms
```

This shows us inbound traffic statistics. In other words, we see that the webapp
is receiving 8.22 requests per second on port 7000 and that only 75.66% of those
requests are successful.

To dig into this further and find the root cause, we can look at the webapp's
outbound traffic. This will tell us about the requests that the webapp makes to
other services.

```bash
linkerd viz -n booksapp stat-outbound deploy/webapp
NAME    SERVICE       ROUTE      TYPE       BACKEND       SUCCESS   RPS  LATENCY_P50  LATENCY_P95  LATENCY_P99  TIMEOUTS  RETRIES  
webapp  books:7002    [default]                            77.36%  7.95         25ms         48ms        176ms     0.00%    0.00%  
                      └──────────────────►  books:7002     77.36%  7.95         15ms         44ms         64ms     0.00%           
webapp  authors:7001  [default]                           100.00%  3.53         26ms         72ms        415ms     0.00%    0.00%  
                      └──────────────────►  authors:7001  100.00%  3.53         16ms         52ms         91ms     0.00%
```

We see that webapp sends traffic to both the books service and the authors
service and that the problem seems to be with the traffic to the books service.

## HTTPRoute

We know that the webapp component is getting failures from the books component,
but it would be great to narrow this down further and get per route metrics. To
do this, we take advantage of the Gateway API and define a set of HTTPRoute
resources, each attached to the `books` Service by specifying it as their
`parent_ref`.

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
kind: HTTPRoute
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: books-list
  namespace: booksapp
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: books
      group: core
      kind: Service
      port: 7002
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: Exact
            value: "/books.json"
---
kind: HTTPRoute
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: books-create
  namespace: booksapp
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: books
      group: core
      kind: Service
      port: 7002
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: Exact
            value: "/books.json"
          method: POST
---
kind: HTTPRoute
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: books-delete
  namespace: booksapp
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: books
      group: core
      kind: Service
      port: 7002
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: RegularExpression
            value: "/books/\\\d+.json"
          method: DELETE
EOF
```

We can then check that these HTTPRoutes have been accepted by their parent
Service by checking their status subresource:

```bash
kubectl -n booksapp get httproutes.gateway.networking.k8s.io \
  -ojsonpath='{.items[*].status.parents[*].conditions[*]}' | jq .
```

Notice that the `Accepted` and `ResolvedRefs` conditions are `True`.

```json
{
  "lastTransitionTime": "2024-08-03T01:38:25Z",
  "message": "",
  "reason": "Accepted",
  "status": "True",
  "type": "Accepted"
}
{
  "lastTransitionTime": "2024-08-03T01:38:25Z",
  "message": "",
  "reason": "ResolvedRefs",
  "status": "True",
  "type": "ResolvedRefs"
}
[...]
```

With those HTTPRoutes in place, we can look at the outbound stats again:

```bash
linkerd viz -n booksapp stat-outbound deploy/webapp
NAME    SERVICE       ROUTE         TYPE       BACKEND       SUCCESS   RPS  LATENCY_P50  LATENCY_P95  LATENCY_P99  TIMEOUTS  RETRIES  
webapp  authors:7001  [default]                              100.00%  2.80         25ms         48ms         50ms     0.00%    0.00%  
                      └─────────────────────►  authors:7001  100.00%  2.80         16ms         45ms         49ms     0.00%           
webapp  books:7002    books-list    HTTPRoute                100.00%  1.43         25ms         48ms         50ms     0.00%    0.00%  
                      └─────────────────────►  books:7002    100.00%  1.43         12ms         24ms         25ms     0.00%

                      └─────────────────────►  books:7002     54.27%  2.73         14ms        152ms        230ms     0.00%           
webapp  books:7002    books-delete  HTTPRoute                100.00%  0.72         25ms         48ms         50ms     0.00%    0.00%  
                      └─────────────────────►  books:7002    100.00%  0.72         12ms         24ms         25ms     0.00%
```

This tells us that it is requests to the `books-create` HTTPRoute which have
been failing.

## Retries

As it can take a while to update code and roll out a new version, let's
tell Linkerd that it can retry requests to the failing endpoint. This will
increase request latencies, as requests will be retried multiple times, but not
require rolling out a new version. Add a retry annotation to the `books-create`
HTTPRoute which tells Linkerd to retry on 5xx responses:

```bash
kubectl -n booksapp annotate httproutes.gateway.networking.k8s.io/books-create \
retry.linkerd.io/http=5xx
```

We can then see the effect of these retries:

```bash
linkerd viz -n booksapp stat-outbound deploy/webapp
NAME    SERVICE       ROUTE         TYPE       BACKEND       SUCCESS   RPS  LATENCY_P50  LATENCY_P95  LATENCY_P99  TIMEOUTS  RETRIES  
webapp  books:7002    books-create  HTTPRoute                 73.17%  2.05         98ms        460ms        492ms     0.00%   34.22%  
                      └─────────────────────►  books:7002     48.13%  3.12         29ms         93ms         99ms     0.00%

                      └─────────────────────►  books:7002    100.00%  1.50         12ms         24ms         25ms     0.00%           
webapp  books:7002    books-delete  HTTPRoute                100.00%  0.73         25ms         48ms         50ms     0.00%    0.00%  
                      └─────────────────────►  books:7002    100.00%  0.73         12ms         24ms         25ms     0.00%           
webapp  authors:7001  [default]                              100.00%  2.98         25ms         48ms         50ms     0.00%    0.00%  
                      └─────────────────────►  authors:7001  100.00%  2.98         16ms         44ms         49ms     0.00%
```

Notice that while the success rate of individual requests to the books backend
on the `books-create` route only have a success rate of about 50%, the overall
success rate on that route has been raised to 73% due to retries. We can also
see that 34.22% of the requests on this route are retries and that the improved
success rate has come at the expense of additional RPS to the backend and
increased overall latency.

By default, Linkerd will only attempt 1 retry per failure. We can improve
success rate further by increasing this limit to allow more than 1 retry
per request:

```bash
kubectl -n booksapp annotate httproutes.gateway.networking.k8s.io/books-create \
retry.linkerd.io/limit=3
```

Looking at the stats again:

```bash
linkerd viz -n booksapp stat-outbound deploy/webapp
NAME    SERVICE       ROUTE         TYPE       BACKEND       SUCCESS   RPS  LATENCY_P50  LATENCY_P95  LATENCY_P99  TIMEOUTS  RETRIES  
webapp  books:7002    books-delete  HTTPRoute                100.00%  0.75         25ms         48ms         50ms     0.00%    0.00%  
                      └─────────────────────►  books:7002    100.00%  0.75         12ms         24ms         25ms     0.00%           
webapp  authors:7001  [default]                              100.00%  2.92         25ms         48ms         50ms     0.00%    0.00%  
                      └─────────────────────►  authors:7001  100.00%  2.92         18ms         46ms         49ms     0.00%           
webapp  books:7002    books-create  HTTPRoute                 92.78%  1.62        111ms        461ms        492ms     0.00%   47.28%  
                      └─────────────────────►  books:7002     48.91%  3.07         42ms        179ms        236ms     0.00%           
webapp  books:7002    books-list    HTTPRoute                100.00%  1.45         25ms         48ms         50ms     0.00%    0.00%  
                      └─────────────────────►  books:7002    100.00%  1.45         12ms         24ms         25ms     0.00%
```

We see that these additional retries have increased the overall success rate on
this route to 92.78%.

## Timeouts

Linkerd can limit how long to wait before failing outgoing requests to another
service. For the purposes of this demo, let's set a 15ms timeout for calls to
the `books-create` route:

```bash
kubectl -n booksapp annotate httproutes.gateway.networking.k8s.io/books-create \
timeout.linkerd.io/request=15ms
```

(You may need to adjust the timeout value depending on your cluster – 15ms
should definitely show some timeouts, but feel free to raise it if you're
getting so many that it's hard to see what's going on!)

We can see the effects of this timeout by running:

```bash
linkerd viz -n booksapp stat-outbound deploy/webapp                         
NAME    SERVICE       ROUTE         TYPE       BACKEND       SUCCESS   RPS  LATENCY_P50  LATENCY_P95  LATENCY_P99  TIMEOUTS  RETRIES  
webapp  authors:7001  [default]                              100.00%  2.85         26ms         49ms        370ms     0.00%    0.00%

                      └─────────────────────►  books:7002    100.00%  1.40         12ms         24ms         25ms     0.00%           
webapp  books:7002    books-delete  HTTPRoute                100.00%  0.70         25ms         48ms         50ms     0.00%    0.00%  
                      └─────────────────────►  books:7002    100.00%  0.70         12ms         24ms         25ms     0.00%
```

We see that 21.10% of the requests are hitting this timeout.

## Clean Up

To remove the books app and the booksapp namespace from your cluster, run:

```bash
kubectl delete ns booksapp
```
