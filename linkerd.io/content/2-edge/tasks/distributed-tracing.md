title: Distributed tracing with Linkerd
description: Use Linkerd to help instrument your application with distributed tracing.
---

Using distributed tracing in practice can be complex. Linkerd can solve some of
these challenges, but is not a silver bullet. For a high level explanation of
how a service mesh can help with distributed tracing, see [Distributed tracing
in the service mesh: four
myths](https://linkerd.io/2019/08/09/service-mesh-distributed-tracing-myths/).

This guide will walk you through configuring and enabling tracing for the
[emojivoto](../getting-started/#step-5-install-the-demo-app) sample application.
Jump to the end for some recommendations on the best way to make use of
distributed tracing with Linkerd.

To use distributed tracing, you'll need to:

- Install a trace collector and viewer on your cluster.
- Update Linkerd to enable tracing.
- Modify your application to emit spans.

In the case of emojivoto, once all these steps are complete there will be a
topology that looks like this:

{{< warning >}}
As of Linkerd 2.19, the Linkerd-jaeger extension has been deprecated and is no
longer available. This guide instead describes how to set up a modern
distributed tracing infrastructure using Jaeger, without this extension. See our
[Guide to migrating away from the Linkerd-jaeger
extension](jaeger-extension-migration).

## Install a trace collector

The first step to a distributed tracing setup is installing a way to collect,
store, and view traces. The collector consumes spans emitted from the mesh and
your applications and sends them to the viewer which stores them and serves a
dashboard to view them.

One common tool to accomplish this is [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/),
which includes a collector, storage, and trace viewer in its all-in-one
installation  We'll use that for our examples.

To install Jaeger using Helm, first add the Jaeger Helm repository:

```bash
helm repo add jaegertracing https://jaegertracing.github.io/helm-charts
```

Then, install the Jaeger Helm chart:

```bash
helm install \
  --wait \
  --namespace jaeger-system \
  --create-namespace \
  --set allInOne.enabled=true \
  --set storage.type=memory \
  --set agent.enabled=false \
  --set collector.enabled=false \
  --set query.enabled=false \
  --set provisionDataStore.cassandra=false \
  jaeger jaegertracing/jaeger
```

{{< warning >}}

The Jaeger all-in-one installation is very simple to set up and get running, but
it is not suitable for a production deployment. Determining what tracing
installation is suitable for your environment is beyond the scope of this doc.

## Update Linkerd to enable tracing

There are a few values that need to be set on your Linkerd installation to
enable exporting traces and to define where to send those traces. In this case,
we'll configure Linkerd to send traces to the Jaeger collector we just
installed.

If Linkerd was installed with the CLI:

```bash
linkerd upgrade \
  --set proxy.tracing.enabled=true \
  --set proxy.tracing.collector.endpoint=jaeger-collector.jaeger-system:4317 \
  --setproxy.tracing.collector.meshIdentity.serviceAccountName=jaeger \
  --setproxy.tracing.collector.meshIdentity.namespace=jaeger-system \
  | kubectl apply -f -
```

Alternatively, if Linkerd was installed via Helm, add the following to the Helm
values for Linkerd:

```yaml
# values.yaml
proxy:
  tracing:
    enabled: true
    collector:
      endpoint: jaeger-collector.jaeger-system:4317
      meshIdentity:
        serviceAccountName: jaeger
        namespace: jaeger-system
```

Linkerd can export traces to any collector which supports the OpenTelemetry
protocol. See the [OpenTelemetry
documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/protocol/) for more
information.

{{< note >}}

At present, the `meshIdentity` stanza is mandatory: Linkerd can only export
traces to a collector within the mesh.

## Install Emojivoto

 Add emojivoto to your cluster and inject it with the Linkerd proxy:

 ```bash
 linkerd inject https://run.linkerd.io/emojivoto.yml | kubectl apply -f -
 ```

Before moving onto the next step, make sure everything is up and running with
`kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl -n emojivoto rollout status deploy/web
```

## Modify the application

Unlike most features of a service mesh, distributed tracing requires some
cooperation from the underlying application: it must propagate certain headers
from inbound requests to any corresponding outbound requests.

This is because distributed tracing needs a way to tie incoming requests to your
application together with outgoing requests to dependent services. To do this,
headers are added to each request that contain a unique ID for the trace.
Linkerd will propagate both [`w3c`](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/) and
[`b3`](https://github.com/openzipkin/b3-propagation) formats to tie these things
together.

{{< note >}}
If both `w3c` and `b3` headers are present, Linkerd will propagate only the
`w3c` headers.
{{< /note >}}

We've already modified emojivoto to instrument its requests with this
information (see [this
commit](https://github.com/BuoyantIO/emojivoto/commit/47a026c2e4085f4e536c2735f3ff3788b0870072)).

To enable tracing in emojivoto, run:

```bash
kubectl -n emojivoto set env --all deploy OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=jaeger-collector.jaeger-system:4317
```

This command will add an environment variable that enables the applications to
propagate context and emit spans. In the meantime, the collector installed with
Linkerd-Jaeger will continue to support both protocols.

## Explore Jaeger

With `vote-bot` starting traces for every request, spans should now be showing
up in Jaeger. To get to the UI, run:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n jaeger-system svc/jaeger 16686
```

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD034 -->
Then, open http://127.0.0.1:16686 in your browser.

![Jaeger](/docs/images/tracing/jaeger-empty.png "Jaeger")

You can search for any service in the dropdown and click Find Traces. `vote-bot`
is a great way to get started.

![Search](/docs/images/tracing/jaeger-search.png "Search")

Clicking on a specific trace will provide all the details, you'll be able to see
the spans for every proxy!

![Search](/docs/images/tracing/example-trace.png "Search")

Note the large number of `linkerd-proxy` spans in the output. Internally, the
proxy has a server and client side. When a request goes through the proxy, it is
received by the server and then issued by the client. For a single request that
goes between two meshed pods, there will be a total of 4 spans. Two will be on
the source side as the request traverses that proxy and two will be on the
destination side as the request is received by the remote proxy.

## Cleanup

To clean up, you'll uninstall emojivoto, turn Linkerd tracing off, and finally
uninstall Jaeger:

```bash
kubectl delete ns emojivoto
linkerd upgrade --set proxy.tracing=null | kubectl apply -f -
kubectl delete ns jaeger-system
```

## Notes

### If you don't see any spans for the proxies

The Linkerd proxy prefers to use the [w3c](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/)
format, while also supporting the
[b3](https://github.com/openzipkin/b3-propagation) format. Some client
libraries, such as Jaeger, use different formats by default. We recommend that
you configure your client library to use the w3c format to have the proxies
participate in traces.

### Ingress

The ingress is an especially important component for distributed tracing because
it typically creates the root span of each trace and is responsible for deciding
if that trace should be sampled or not.  Having the ingress make all sampling
decisions ensures that either an entire trace is sampled or none of it is, and
avoids creating "partial traces".

This reference architecture uses a traffic generator called `vote-bot` instead
of an ingress to create the root span of each trace.

### Client libraries

While it is possible for applications to manually propagate trace propagation
headers, it's usually much easier to use a library. Typical distributed tracing
libraries do three things:

- Propagate the trace context from incoming request headers to outgoing request
  headers
- Modify the trace context (i.e. starts a new span)
- Transmit this data to a trace collector

For example, the OpenTelemetry agent exporter will export trace data to the
OpenTelemetry collector over a gRPC API. The details of how to configure
OpenTelemetry will vary language by language, but there are [guides for many
popular languages](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/).

### Jaeger vs alternatives

In this guide, we used Jaeger, one of the most widely used tracing backends.
However, any backend supported by OpenTelemetry can be used.

## Proxy header propagation

If your application is injected with Linkerd, the Linkerd proxy will participate
in the traces and will also emit trace data to the trace collector. This
enriches the trace data and allows you to see exactly how much time requests are
spending in the proxy and on the wire.

While Linkerd can only actively participate in traces that use the w3c or b3
propagation formats, Linkerd will always forward unknown request headers
transparently, which means it will never interfere with traces that use other
propagation formats.
