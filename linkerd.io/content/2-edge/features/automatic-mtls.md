faqs:
  - question: What traffic can Linkerd automatically mTLS?
    answer: Linkerd transparently applies mTLS to all TCP communication between
      meshed pods. However, there are still ways in which you may still have
      non-mTLS traffic in your system, including traffic to or from non-meshed
      pods (e.g. Kubernetes healthchecks), and traffic on ports that were
      marked as skip ports, which bypass the proxy entirely.

  - question: How does Linkerd's mTLS implementation work?
    answer: The Linkerd control plane contains a certificate authority (CA)
      called "identity". This CA issues TLS certificates to each Linkerd data
      plane proxy. Each certificate is bound to the Kubernetes ServiceAccount
      of the containing pod. These TLS certificates expire after 24 hours and
      are automatically rotated. The proxies use these certificates to encrypt
      and authenticate TCP traffic to other proxies.

  - question: What is mTLS?
    answer: mTLS, or mutual TLS, is simply "regular TLS" with the extra
      stipulation that the client is also authenticated. TLS guarantees
      authenticity, but by default this only happens in one direction--the
      client authenticates the server but the server doesn’t authenticate the
      client. mTLS makes the authenticity symmetric.

By default, Linkerd automatically enables mutually-authenticated Transport
Layer Security (mTLS) for all TCP traffic between meshed pods. This means that
Linkerd adds authenticated, encrypted communication to your application with
no extra work on your part. (And because the Linkerd control plane also runs
on the data plane, this means that communication between Linkerd's control
plane components are also automatically secured via mTLS.)

See [Caveats and future work](#caveats-and-future-work) below for some details.

## What is mTLS?

mTLS, or mutual TLS, is simply "regular TLS" with the extra stipulation that
the client is also authenticated. TLS guarantees authenticity, but by default
this only happens in one direction--the client authenticates the server but the
server doesn’t authenticate the client. mTLS makes the authenticity symmetric.

mTLS is a large topic. For a broad overview of what mTLS is and how it works in
Kuberentes clusters, we suggest reading through [A Kubernetes engineer's guide
to mTLS](https://buoyant.io/mtls-guide/).

## Which traffic can Linkerd automatically mTLS?

Linkerd transparently applies mTLS to all TCP communication between meshed
pods. However, there are still ways in which you may still have non-mTLS
traffic in your system, including:

* Traffic to or from non-meshed pods (e.g. Kubernetes healthchecks)
* Traffic on ports that were marked as [skip ports](../protocol-detection/),
  which bypass the proxy entirely.

You can [verify which traffic is mTLS'd](../../tasks/validating-your-traffic/)
in a variety of ways. External systems such as [Buoyant
Cloud](https://buoyant.io/cloud) can also automatically generate reports of TLS
traffic patterns on your cluster.

## Operational concerns

Linkerd's mTLS requires some preparation for production use, especially for
long-lived clusters or clusters that expect to have cross-cluster traffic.

The trust anchor generated by the default `linkerd install` CLI command expires
after 365 days. After that, it must be [manually
rotated](../../tasks/manually-rotating-control-plane-tls-credentials/)—a
non-trivial task. Alternatively, you can [provide the trust anchor
yourself](../../tasks/generate-certificates/) and control the expiration date,
e.g. setting it to 10 years rather than one year.

Kubernetes clusters that make use of Linkerd's [multi-cluster
communication](../multicluster/) must share a trust anchor. Thus, the default
`linkerd install` setup will not work for this situation and you must provide
an explicit trust anchor.

Similarly, the default cluster issuer certificate and key expire after a year.
These must be [rotated before they
expire](../../tasks/manually-rotating-control-plane-tls-credentials/).
Alternatively, you can [set up automatic rotation with
`cert-manager`](../../tasks/automatically-rotating-control-plane-tls-credentials/).

External systems such as [Buoyant Cloud](https://buoyant.io/cloud) can be used
to monitor cluster credentials and to send reminders if they are close to
expiration.

## How does Linkerd's mTLS implementation work?

The [Linkerd control plane](../../reference/architecture/) contains a certificate
authority (CA) called `identity`. This CA issues TLS certificates to each
Linkerd data plane proxy.  Each certificate is bound to the [Kubernetes
ServiceAccount](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/)
identity of the containing pod. These TLS certificates expire after 24 hours
and are automatically rotated. The proxies use these certificates to encrypt
and authenticate TCP traffic to other proxies.

On the control plane side, Linkerd maintains a set of credentials in the
cluster: a trust anchor, and an issuer certificate and private key. These
credentials can be generated by Linkerd during install time, or optionally
provided by an external source, e.g.  [Vault](https://vaultproject.io) or
[cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager). The issuer
certificate and private key are stored in a [Kubernetes
Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/); this Secret
is placed in the `linkerd` namespace and can only be read by the service
account used by the [Linkerd control plane](../../reference/architecture/)'s
`identity` component.

On the data plane side, each proxy is passed the trust anchor in an environment
variable. At startup, the proxy generates a private key, stored in a [tmpfs
emptyDir](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir) which
stays in memory and never leaves the pod. The proxy connects to the control
plane's `identity` component, validating the connection to `identity` with the
trust anchor, and issues a [certificate signing request
(CSR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_signing_request). The CSR
contains an initial certificate with identity set to the pod's [Kubernetes
ServiceAccount](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/),
and the actual service account token, so that `identity` can validate that the
CSR is valid. After validation, the signed trust bundle is returned to the
proxy, which can use it as both a client and server certificate. These
certificates are scoped to 24 hours and dynamically refreshed using the same
mechanism.

Finally, when a proxy receives an outbound connection from the application
container within its pod, it looks up that destination with the Linkerd control
plane. If it's in the Kubernetes cluster, the control plane provides the proxy
with the destination's endpoint addresses, along with metadata including an
identity name. When the proxy connects to the destination, it initiates a TLS
handshake and verifies that that the destination proxy's certificate is signed
by the trust anchor and contains the expected identity.

## TLS protocol parameters

Linkerd currently uses the following TLS protocol parameters for mTLS
connections, although they may change in future versions:

* TLS version 1.3
* Cipher suite `TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256` as specified in [RFC
  8446](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-9.1).

## Caveats and future work

* Linkerd does not *require* mTLS unless [authorization policies](../server-policy/)
  are configured.

* Ideally, the ServiceAccount token that Linkerd uses would not be shared with
  other potential uses of that token. In future Kubernetes releases, Kubernetes
  will support audience/time-bound ServiceAccount tokens, and Linkerd will use
  those instead.
