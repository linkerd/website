title: Manually Rotating Control Plane TLS Credentials
description: Update Linkerd's TLS trust anchor and issuer certificate.
---

Linkerd's [automatic mTLS](../features/automatic-mtls/) feature uses a set of
TLS credentials to generate TLS certificates for proxies: a trust anchor, and an
issuer certificate and private key. The trust anchor has a limited period of
validity: 365 days if generated by `linkerd install`, or a customized value if
[generated manually](generate-certificates/).

Thus, for clusters that are expected to outlive this lifetime, you must manually
rotate the trust anchor. In this document, we describe how to accomplish this
without downtime.

Independent of the trust anchor, the issuer certificate and key pair can also
expire (though it is possible to
[use `cert-manager` to set up automatic rotation](automatically-rotating-control-plane-tls-credentials/).
This document also covers how to rotate the issuer certificate and key pair
without downtime.

## Prerequisites

These instructions use the following CLI tools:

- [`step`](https://smallstep.com/cli/) to manipulate certificates and keys;

## Understanding the current state of your system

Begin by running:

```bash
linkerd check --proxy
```

If your configuration is valid and your credentials are not expiring soon, you
should see output similar to:

```text {class=disable-copy}
linkerd-identity
----------------
√ certificate config is valid
√ trust roots are using supported crypto algorithm
√ trust roots are within their validity period
√ trust roots are valid for at least 60 days
√ issuer cert is using supported crypto algorithm
√ issuer cert is within its validity period
√ issuer cert is valid for at least 60 days
√ issuer cert is issued by the trust root

linkerd-identity-data-plane
---------------------------
√ data plane proxies certificate match CA
```

However, if you see a message warning you that your trust anchor ("trust root")
or issuer certificates are expiring soon, then you must rotate them.

**Note that this document only applies if the trust anchor is currently valid.**
If your trust anchor has expired, follow the
[Replacing Expired Certificates Guide](replacing_expired_certificates/) instead.
(If your issuer certificate has expired but your trust anchor is still valid,
continue on with this document.)

For example, if your issuer certificate has expired, you will see a message
similar to:

```text {class=disable-copy}
linkerd-identity
----------------
√ certificate config is valid
√ trust roots are using supported crypto algorithm
√ trust roots are within their validity period
√ trust roots are valid for at least 60 days
√ issuer cert is using supported crypto algorithm
× issuer cert is within its validity period
issuer certificate is not valid anymore. Expired on 2019-12-19T09:02:01Z
see https://linkerd.io/2/checks/#l5d-identity-issuer-cert-is-time-valid for hints
```

If your trust anchor has expired, you will see a message similar to:

```text {class=disable-copy}
linkerd-identity
----------------
√ certificate config is valid
√ trust roots are using supported crypto algorithm
× trust roots are within their validity period
Invalid roots:
* 79461543992952791393769540277800684467 identity.linkerd.cluster.local not valid anymore. Expired on 2019-12-19T09:11:30Z
see https://linkerd.io/2/checks/#l5d-identity-roots-are-time-valid  for hints
```

## Rotating the trust anchor

Rotating the trust anchor without downtime is a multi-step process: you must
generate a new trust anchor, bundle it with the old one, rotate the issuer
certificate and key pair, and finally remove the old trust anchor from the
bundle. If you simply need to rotate the issuer certificate and key pair, you
can skip directly to
[Rotating the identity issuer certificate](#rotating-the-identity-issuer-certificate)
and ignore the trust anchor rotation steps.

## Read the current trust anchor certificate from the cluster

To avoid downtime, you need to bundle the existing trust anchor certificate with
the newly-generated trust anchor certificate into a certificate bundle: using
the bundle allows workloads ultimately signed with either trust anchor to work
properly in the mesh. Since certificates are not sensitive information, we can
simply pull the existing trust anchor certificate directly from the cluster.

The following command uses `kubectl` to fetch the Linkerd config from the
`linkerd-identity-trust-roots` ConfigMap and save it in `original-trust.crt`:

```bash
kubectl -n linkerd get cm linkerd-identity-trust-roots -o=jsonpath='{.data.ca-bundle\.crt}' > original-trust.crt
```

## Generate a new trust anchor

After saving the current trust anchor certificate, generate a new trust anchor
certificate and private key:

```bash
step certificate create root.linkerd.cluster.local ca-new.crt ca-new.key --profile root-ca --no-password --insecure
```

Note that we use `--no-password --insecure` to avoid encrypting these files with
a passphrase. Store the private key somewhere secure so that it can be used in
the future to [generate new issuer certificates](generate-certificates/).

## Bundle your original trust anchor with the new one

Next, we need to bundle the trust anchor currently used by Linkerd together with
the new anchor. We use `step` to combine the two certificates into one bundle:

```bash
step certificate bundle ca-new.crt original-trust.crt bundle.crt
```

If desired, you can `rm original-trust.crt` too.

## Deploying the new bundle to Linkerd

At this point you can use the `linkerd upgrade` command to instruct Linkerd to
work with the new trust bundle:

```bash
linkerd upgrade --identity-trust-anchors-file=./bundle.crt | kubectl apply -f -
```

or you can also use the `helm upgrade` command:

```bash
helm upgrade linkerd-control-plane --set-file identityTrustAnchorsPEM=./bundle.crt
```

Once this is done, you'll need to restart your meshed workloads so that they use
the new trust anchor. For example, doing that for the `emojivoto` namespace
would look like:

```bash
kubectl -n emojivoto rollout restart deploy
```

Now you can run the `check` command to ensure that everything is ok:

```bash
linkerd check --proxy
```

You might have to wait a few moments until all the pods have been restarted and
are configured with the correct trust anchor. Meanwhile you might observe
warnings:

```text {class=disable-copy}
linkerd-identity
----------------
√ certificate config is valid
√ trust roots are using supported crypto algorithm
√ trust roots are within their validity period
√ trust roots are valid for at least 60 days
√ issuer cert is using supported crypto algorithm
√ issuer cert is within its validity period
‼ issuer cert is valid for at least 60 days
    issuer certificate will expire on 2019-12-19T09:51:19Z
    see https://linkerd.io/2/checks/#l5d-identity-issuer-cert-not-expiring-soon for hints
√ issuer cert is issued by the trust root

linkerd-identity-data-plane
---------------------------
‼ data plane proxies certificate match CA
    Some pods do not have the current trust bundle and must be restarted:
        * emojivoto/emoji-d8d7d9c6b-8qwfx
        * emojivoto/vote-bot-588499c9f6-zpwz6
        * emojivoto/voting-8599548fdc-6v64k
        * emojivoto/web-67c7599f6d-xx98n
        * linkerd/linkerd-sp-validator-75f9d96dc-rch4x
        * linkerd/linkerd-tap-68d8bbf64-mpzgb

    see https://linkerd.io/2/checks/#l5d-identity-data-plane-proxies-certs-match-ca for hints
```

When the rollout completes, your `check` command should stop warning you that
pods need to be restarted. It may still warn you, however, that your issuer
certificate is about to expire soon:

```text {class=disable-copy}
linkerd-identity
----------------
√ certificate config is valid
√ trust roots are using supported crypto algorithm
√ trust roots are within their validity period
√ trust roots are valid for at least 60 days
√ issuer cert is using supported crypto algorithm
√ issuer cert is within its validity period
‼ issuer cert is valid for at least 60 days
    issuer certificate will expire on 2019-12-19T09:51:19Z
    see https://linkerd.io/2/checks/#l5d-identity-issuer-cert-not-expiring-soon for hints
√ issuer cert is issued by the trust root

linkerd-identity-data-plane
---------------------------
√ data plane proxies certificate match CA
```

At this point, all meshed workloads are ready to accept connections signed by
either the old or new trust anchor, but they're all still using certificates
signed by the old trust anchor. To change that, we'll need to rotate the issuer
certificate.

## Rotating the identity issuer certificate

To rotate the issuer certificate and key pair, start by generating the new
identity issuer certificate and key:

```bash
step certificate create identity.linkerd.cluster.local issuer-new.crt issuer-new.key \
--profile intermediate-ca --not-after 8760h --no-password --insecure \
--ca ca-new.crt --ca-key ca-new.key
```

This new issuer certificate is signed by our new trust anchor, which is why it
was critical to install the new trust anchor bundle (as outlined in the previous
section). Once the new bundle is installed and running `linkerd check` shows all
green checks and no warnings, you can safely rotate the identity issuer
certificate and key by using the `upgrade` command again:

```bash
linkerd upgrade \
    --identity-issuer-certificate-file=./issuer-new.crt \
    --identity-issuer-key-file=./issuer-new.key \
    | kubectl apply -f -
```

or

```bash
helm upgrade linkerd-control-plane \
  --set-file identity.issuer.tls.crtPEM=./issuer-new.crt \
  --set-file identity.issuer.tls.keyPEM=./issuer-new.key
```

At this point you can check for the `IssuerUpdated` Kubernetes event to be
certain that Linkerd saw the new issuer certificate:

```bash
kubectl get events --field-selector reason=IssuerUpdated -n linkerd

LAST SEEN   TYPE     REASON          OBJECT                        MESSAGE
9s          Normal   IssuerUpdated   deployment/linkerd-identity   Updated identity issuer
```

Restart the proxy for all injected workloads in your cluster to ensure that
their proxies pick up certificates issued by the new issuer:

```bash
kubectl -n emojivoto rollout restart deploy
```

Run the `check` command to make sure that everything is going as expected:

```bash
linkerd check --proxy
```

You should see output without any certificate expiration warnings (unless an
expired trust anchor still needs to be removed):

```text {class=disable-copy}
linkerd-identity
----------------
√ certificate config is valid
√ trust roots are using supported crypto algorithm
√ trust roots are within their validity period
√ trust roots are valid for at least 60 days
√ issuer cert is using supported crypto algorithm
√ issuer cert is within its validity period
√ issuer cert is valid for at least 60 days
√ issuer cert is issued by the trust root

linkerd-identity-data-plane
---------------------------
√ data plane proxies certificate match CA
```

## Removing the old trust anchor

Since the old trust anchor is now completely unused, we can now switch Linkerd
from the bundle we created for the trust anchor to using only the new trust
anchor certificate:

```bash
linkerd upgrade  --identity-trust-anchors-file=./ca-new.crt  | kubectl apply -f -
```

or

```bash
helm upgrade linkerd2 --set-file --set-file identityTrustAnchorsPEM=./ca-new.crt
```

Note that the ./ca-new.crt file is the same trust anchor you created at the
start of this process.

Once again, explicitly restart your meshed workloads:

```bash
kubectl -n emojivoto rollout restart deploy
linkerd check --proxy
```

And, again, the output of the `check` command should not produce any warnings or
errors:

```text {class=disable-copy}
linkerd-identity
----------------
√ certificate config is valid
√ trust roots are using supported crypto algorithm
√ trust roots are within their validity period
√ trust roots are valid for at least 60 days
√ issuer cert is using supported crypto algorithm
√ issuer cert is within its validity period
√ issuer cert is valid for at least 60 days
√ issuer cert is issued by the trust root

linkerd-identity-data-plane
---------------------------
√ data plane proxies certificate match CA
```

Congratulations, you have rotated your trust anchor! 🎉
