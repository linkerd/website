title: Adding non-Kubernetes workloads to your mesh
---

In this guide, we'll walk you through an example of
[mesh expansion](../features/non-kubernetes-workloads): setting up and
configuring an example non-Kubernetes workload and adding it to your Linkerd
mesh.

## Overall flow

In this guide, we'll take you through how to:

1. Install the Linkerd proxy onto a virtual or physical machine outside the
   Kubernetes cluster.
1. Configure network rules so traffic is routed through the proxy.
1. Register the external workload in the mesh.
1. Exercise traffic patterns and apply authorization policies that affect the
   external workload.

We'll be using [SPIRE](https://github.com/spiffe/spire) as our identity
mechanism to generate a workload identity.

## Prerequisites

You will need:

- A functioning Linkerd installation and its trust anchor.
- A cluster that you have elevated privileges to. For local development, you can
  use [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) or [k3d](https://k3d.io/).
- A physical or virtual machine.
- `NET_CAP` privileges on the machine, so iptables rules can be modified.
- IP connectivity from the machine to every pod in the mesh.
- A working DNS setup such that the machine is able to resolve DNS names for
  in-cluster Kubernetes workloads.

## Getting the current trust anchor and key

To be able to use mutual TLS across cluster boundaries, the off-cluster machine
and the cluster need to have a shared trust anchor. For the purposes of this
tutorial, we will assume that you have access to the trust anchor certificate
and secret key for your Linkerd deployment and placed it in files called
`ca.key` and `ca.crt`.

## Install SPIRE on your machine

Linkerd's proxies normally obtain TLS certificates from the identity component
of Linkerd's control plane. In order to attest their identity, they use the
Kubernetes Service Account token that is provided to each Pod.

Since our external workload lives outside of Kubernetes, the concept of Service
Account tokens does not exist. Instead, we turn to the
[SPIFFE framework](https://spiffe.io) and its SPIRE implementation to create
identities for off-cluster resources. Thus, for mesh expansion, we configure the
Linkerd proxy to obtain its certificates directly from SPIRE instead of the
Linkerd's identity service. The magic of SPIFFE is that these certificates are
compatible with those generated by Linkerd on the cluster.

In production, you may already have your own identity infrastructure built on
top of SPIFFE that can be used by the proxies on external machines. For this
tutorial however, we can take you through installing and setting up a minimal
SPIRE environment on your machine. To begin with you need to install SPIRE by
downloading it from the
[SPIRE GitHub releases page](https://github.com/spiffe/spire/releases). For
example:

```bash
wget https://github.com/spiffe/SPIRE/releases/download/v1.8.2/SPIRE-1.8.2-linux-amd64-musl.tar.gz
tar zvxf SPIRE-1.8.2-linux-amd64-musl.tar.gz
cp -r SPIRE-1.8.2/. /opt/SPIRE/
```

Then you need to configure the SPIRE server on your machine:

```bash
cat >/opt/SPIRE/server.cfg <<EOL
server {
    bind_address = "127.0.0.1"
    bind_port = "8081"
    trust_domain = "root.linkerd.cluster.local"
    data_dir = "/opt/SPIRE/data/server"
    log_level = "DEBUG"
    ca_ttl = "168h"
    default_x509_svid_ttl = "48h"
}

plugins {
    DataStore "sql" {
        plugin_data {
            database_type = "sqlite3"
            connection_string = "/opt/SPIRE/data/server/datastore.sqlite3"
        }
    }

    KeyManager "disk" {
        plugin_data {
            keys_path = "/opt/SPIRE/data/server/keys.json"
        }
    }

    NodeAttestor "join_token" {
        plugin_data {}
    }

    UpstreamAuthority "disk" {
        plugin_data {
            cert_file_path = "/opt/SPIRE/certs/ca.crt"
            key_file_path = "/opt/SPIRE/certs/ca.key"
            }
    }
}
EOL
```

This file configures the SPIRE server. It assumes that your root cert and key
that you have installed Linkerd with are placed in the `/opt/SPIRE/certs`
directory.

Additionally, you need will need to configure the SPIRE agent:

```bash
cat >/opt/SPIRE/agent.cfg <<EOL
agent {
    data_dir = "/opt/SPIRE/data/agent"
    log_level = "DEBUG"
    trust_domain = "root.linkerd.cluster.local"
    server_address = "localhost"
    server_port = 8081

    # Insecure bootstrap is NOT appropriate for production use but is ok for
    # simple testing/evaluation purposes.
    insecure_bootstrap = true
}

plugins {
   KeyManager "disk" {
        plugin_data {
            directory = "/opt/SPIRE/data/agent"
        }
    }

    NodeAttestor "join_token" {
        plugin_data {}
    }

    WorkloadAttestor "unix" {
        plugin_data {}
    }
}
EOL
```

Now you need to start the server and provide a registration policy for your
workload. The server is the component that issues certificates. To begin with,
start the SPIRE server and verify that it is healthy:

```bash
SPIRE-server run -config ./server.cfg &&
SPIRE-server healthcheck
```

Now you need to register the agent and run it. The agent queries the SPIRE
server to attest (authenticate) workloads.

```bash
AGENT_TOKEN=$(SPIRE-server token generate -spiffeID spiffe://root.linkerd.cluster.local/agent -output json | jq -r '.value')
SPIRE-agent run -config ./agent.cfg -joinToken "$AGENT_TOKEN" &
SPIRE-agent healthcheck

Agent is healthy.
```

After both the server and agent are running, you need to provide a registration
policy for your workload. For the sake of simplicity, we can put together a
simple registration policy that hands out a predefined SPIFFE identity to any
process that runs under the root UID.

```bash
SPIRE-server entry create -parentID spiffe://root.linkerd.cluster.local/agent  \
    -spiffeID spiffe://root.linkerd.cluster.local/external-workload -selector unix:uid:$(id -u root)

Entry ID      : ac5e2354-596a-4059-85f7-5b76e3bb53b3
SPIFFE ID     : spiffe://root.linkerd.cluster.local/external-workload
Parent ID     : spiffe://root.linkerd.cluster.local/agent
TTL           : 3600
Selector      : unix:uid:0
```

## Registering the external workload with the mesh

For Linkerd to know about the external workload and be able to route traffic to
it, we need to supply some information. This is done via an `ExternalWorkload`
CRD that needs to be present in the cluster. Create one now:

```yaml
machine_IP=<the ip address of your machine>
kubectl --context=west apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: workload.linkerd.io/v1beta1
kind: ExternalWorkload
metadata:
  name: external-workload
  namespace: mixed-env
  labels:
    location: vm
    app: legacy-app
    workload_name: external-workload
spec:
  meshTLS:
    identity: "spiffe://root.linkerd.cluster.local/external-workload"
    serverName: "external-workload.cluster.local"
  workloadIPs:
  - ip: $machine_IP
  ports:
  - port: 80
    name: http
status:
  conditions:
    - type: Ready
      status: "True"
      lastTransitionTime: "2024-01-24T11:53:43Z"
EOF
```

This will create an `ExternalWorkload` resource that will be used to discover
workloads that live outside of Kubernetes. A Service object can select over
these resources the same way it selects over Pods, but more on that later.

## Installing the Linkerd proxy on the machine

We need to install and run the Linkerd proxy on the machine. Typically the proxy
runs as a container in Kubernetes. The container itself has some additional
machinery that is specific to bootstrapping identity in Kubernetes environments.
When in a foreign environment, we do not need this functionality, so we can
simply get the proxy binary:

```bash
LINKERD_VERSION={{< edge-version >}}
mkdir /opt/linkerd-proxy && cd /opt/linkerd-proxy
id=$(docker create cr.l5d.io/linkerd/proxy:$LINKERD_VERSION)
docker cp $id:/usr/lib/linkerd/linkerd2-proxy ./linkerd-proxy
docker rm -v $id
```

## Configuring and running the proxy

The machine network configuration needs to be set up for traffic to be steered
through the proxy. This could be done by adding the following iptables rules:

```bash
PROXY_INBOUND_PORT=4143
PROXY_OUTBOUND_PORT=4140
PROXY_USER_UID=$(id -u root)
# default inbound and outbound ports to ignore
INBOUND_PORTS_TO_IGNORE="4190,4191,4567,4568"
OUTBOUND_PORTS_TO_IGNORE="4567,4568"

iptables -t nat -N PROXY_INIT_REDIRECT
# ignore inbound ports
iptables -t nat -A PROXY_INIT_REDIRECT -p tcp --match multiport --dports $INBOUND_PORTS_TO_IGNORE -j RETURN
# redirect all incoming traffic to proxy's inbound port
iptables -t nat -A PROXY_INIT_REDIRECT -p tcp -j REDIRECT --to-port $PROXY_INBOUND_PORT
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -j PROXY_INIT_REDIRECT

# outbound rules
iptables -t nat -N PROXY_INIT_OUTPUT
# ignore proxy user
iptables -t nat -A PROXY_INIT_OUTPUT -m owner --uid-owner $PROXY_USER_UID -j RETURN
# ignore loopback
iptables -t nat -A PROXY_INIT_OUTPUT -o lo -j RETURN
# ignore outbound ports
iptables -t nat -A PROXY_INIT_OUTPUT -p tcp --match multiport --dports $OUTBOUND_PORTS_TO_IGNORE -j RETURN
# redirect all outgoing traffic proxy's outbound port
iptables -t nat -A PROXY_INIT_OUTPUT -p tcp -j REDIRECT --to-port $PROXY_OUTBOUND_PORT
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -j PROXY_INIT_OUTPUT
iptables-save -t nat
```

These rules ensure that traffic is correctly routed through the proxy. Now that
this is done, we need to run the proxy with the correct environment variables
set up:

```bash
export LINKERD2_PROXY_IDENTITY_SERVER_ID="spiffe://root.linkerd.cluster.local/external-workload"
export LINKERD2_PROXY_IDENTITY_SERVER_NAME="external-workload.cluster.local"
export LINKERD2_PROXY_POLICY_WORKLOAD="{\"ns\":\"mixed-env\", \"external_workload\":\"external-workload\"}"
export LINKERD2_PROXY_DESTINATION_CONTEXT="{\"ns\":\"mixed-env\", \"nodeName\":\"my-vm\", \"external_workload\":\"external-workload\"}"
export LINKERD2_PROXY_DESTINATION_SVC_ADDR="linkerd-dst-headless.linkerd.svc.cluster.local.:8086"
export LINKERD2_PROXY_DESTINATION_SVC_NAME="linkerd-destination.linkerd.serviceaccount.identity.linkerd.cluster.local"
export LINKERD2_PROXY_POLICY_SVC_NAME="linkerd-destination.linkerd.serviceaccount.identity.linkerd.cluster.local"
export LINKERD2_PROXY_POLICY_SVC_ADDR="linkerd-policy.linkerd.svc.cluster.local.:8090"
export LINKERD2_PROXY_IDENTITY_SPIRE_SOCKET="unix:///tmp/spire-agent/public/api.sock"
export LINKERD2_PROXY_IDENTITY_TRUST_ANCHORS=`cat /opt/SPIRE/crts/ca.crt`

./linkerd-proxy
```

## Start an application workload on the machine

Now that the proxy is running on the machine, you can start another workload on
it that will be reachable from within the cluster. Make sure that you run this
application under a user account different than the one the proxy is using.
Let's use the `bb` utility to mimic a workload:

```bash
docker run -p 80:80 buoyantio/bb:v0.0.5 terminus \
    --h1-server-port 80 \
    --response-text hello-from-external-vm
```

## Send encrypted traffic from and to the machine

Now that everything is running, you can send traffic from an in-cluster workload
to the machine. Let's start by creating our client as a workload in the cluster:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: client
  namespace: mixed-env
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: client
  namespace: mixed-env
  annotations:
    linkerd.io/inject: enabled
spec:
  volumes:
  - name: shared-data
    emptyDir: {}
  containers:
  - name: client
    image: docker.io/curlimages/curl:latest
    command:
      - "sh"
      - "-c"
      - >
        while true; do
          sleep 3600;
        done
  serviceAccountName: client
EOF
```

You can also create a service that selects over both the machine as well as an
in-cluster workload:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: legacy-app
  namespace: mixed-env
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: legacy-app
  ports:
  - port: 80
    protocol: TCP
    name: one
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: legacy-app-cluster
  namespace: mixed-env
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: legacy-app
    location: cluster
  ports:
  - port: 80
    protocol: TCP
    name: one
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  namespace: mixed-env
  name: legacy-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: legacy-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: legacy-app
        location: cluster
      annotations:
        linkerd.io/inject: enabled
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: legacy-app
          image: buoyantio/bb:v0.0.5
          command: [ "sh", "-c"]
          args:
          - "/out/bb terminus --h1-server-port 80 --response-text hello-from-$POD_NAME --fire-and-forget"
          ports:
            - name: http-port
              containerPort: 80
          env:
            - name: POD_NAME
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  fieldPath: metadata.name
EOF
```

Now you can ssh into the client pod and observe traffic being load-balanced
between both the in-cluster workload and the machine:

```bash
kubectl exec -c client --stdin --tty client -n mixed-env -- sh
while sleep 1; do curl -s http://legacy-app.mixed-env.svc.cluster.local:80/who-am-i| jq .; done

{
  "requestUID": "in:http-sid:terminus-grpc:-1-h1:80-571813026",
  "payload": "hello-from-external-workload"
}
{
  "requestUID": "in:http-sid:terminus-grpc:-1-h1:80-599832807",
  "payload": "hello-from-legacy-app-d4446455b-2fgcr"
}
{
  "requestUID": "in:http-sid:terminus-grpc:-1-h1:80-634437030",
  "payload": "hello-from-external-workload"
}
{
  "requestUID": "in:http-sid:terminus-grpc:-1-h1:80-667578518",
  "payload": "hello-from-external-workload"
}
```

Similarly, you can send traffic from the machine to the cluster:

```bash
while sleep 1; do curl -s http://legacy-app-cluster.mixed-env.svc.cluster.local:80/who-am-i| jq .; done

# You should start seeing responses from the in-cluster workload.
{
  "requestUID": "in:http-sid:terminus-grpc:-1-h1:80-824112662",
  "payload": "hello-from-legacy-app-6bb4854789-x4wbw"
}
{
  "requestUID": "in:http-sid:terminus-grpc:-1-h1:80-858574572",
  "payload": "hello-from-legacy-app-6bb4854789-x4wbw"
}
{
  "requestUID": "in:http-sid:terminus-grpc:-1-h1:80-895218927",
  "payload": "hello-from-legacy-app-6bb4854789-x4wbw"
}
```

## Use authorization policies with machines

Although the identity of the proxy running on the machine is not tied to a
Kubernetes service account, there is still an attested identity that can be used
to define authorization policies. Let's limit the kind of traffic that can reach
our in-cluster workload. Create a `Server` resource now:

```yaml
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: policy.linkerd.io/v1beta2
kind: Server
metadata:
  name: in-cluster-endpoint
  namespace: mixed-env
  annotations:
    config.linkerd.io/default-inbound-policy: "deny"
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: legacy-app
  port: http
  proxyProtocol: HTTP/1
EOF
```

You can observe that we no longer get responses when we try and target the
in-cluster workload from the machine. This is because our default policy is
`deny`. We can fix that by explicitly allowing traffic from the machine by
creating a policy that allows its SPIFFE id:

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: policy.linkerd.io/v1beta2
kind: Server
metadata:
  name: in-cluster-endpoint
  namespace: mixed-env
  annotations:
    config.linkerd.io/default-inbound-policy: "deny"
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: legacy-app
  port: http
  proxyProtocol: HTTP/1
apiVersion: policy.linkerd.io/v1alpha1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
  name: in-cluster-endpoint-authn
  namespace: mixed-env
spec:
  targetRef:
    group: policy.linkerd.io
    kind: Server
    name: in-cluster-endpoint
  requiredAuthenticationRefs:
  - name: in-cluster-endpoint-mtls
    kind: MeshTLSAuthentication
    group: policy.linkerd.io
---
apiVersion: policy.linkerd.io/v1alpha1
kind: MeshTLSAuthentication
metadata:
  name: in-cluster-endpoint-mtls
  namespace: mixed-env
spec:
  identities:
    - "spiffe://root.linkerd.cluster.local/external-workload"
EOF
```

When this policy is applied, you can observe that traffic is allowed from the
machine to the in-cluster workload. Similarly, you can attach policies to an
external workload object by using the `externalWorkloadSelector` field of the
`Server` object.

## That's it

Congrats! You have successfully meshed a non-Kubernetes workload with Linkerd
and demonstrated secure, reliable communication between it and the meshed pods
on your cluster.
