+++
Wednesday is our December online community meetup! Join us for this month's
online Linkerd community meeting! William, Oliver, Thomas, and other Linkerd
maintainers will discuss Linkerd roadmap, releases, and anything else on the
agenda.

We'll also be announcing the December Linkerd Hero. This is a way to recognize
community members who help out on Slack or answer questions on Stackoverflow,
share successes and failures with their peers, or contribute to the codebase and
improve the Linkerd service mesh --- without our heroes, Linkerd wouldn't be
what it is today. [Please submit your vote](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfrJFZSbcN94zuY18BvPorfB-sHE66dRl7rlq8jSq1BZnefog/viewform)
by Tuesday, December 8, midnight PT.

We hope to see you there!
