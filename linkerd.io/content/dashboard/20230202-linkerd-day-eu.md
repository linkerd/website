The Linkerd maintainers are thrilled to announce the first ever [Linkerd Day],
happening in Amsterdam on 18 April, 2023, at KubeCon/CloudNativeCon!

[Linkerd Day] is a practitioner-driven community conference, emphasizing
end-user case studies and technical talks. Interested in [speaking]? The CFP
is open until 12 February, and we're available to help with proposals if
needed! Just ask in the `#workshops` channel, or DM `@Flynn` or `@Catherine`,
in the [Linkerd Slack]!
