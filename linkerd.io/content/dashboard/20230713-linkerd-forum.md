Looking for a new way to get help from the Linkerd maintainers and community
members? Sad that messages disappear on Slack? GitHub discussions too galling
for you?

We're pleased to announce the [Linkerd Forum] to help with all these issues!
It's a place where you can post questions, get help, and search the entire
existing conversation. We hope to see you there!
