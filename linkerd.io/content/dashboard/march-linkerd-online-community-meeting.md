We’ll chat about the 2.10 release and look at what’s next, as well as be joined by Sergio Mendéz to chat about his passion for teaching Linkerd and cloud native technologies. We’ll also announce March’s Linkerd Hero, so don’t forget to [submit your vote](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScXwgZpLsVW0SQNKtUgVOgEdL2fD9tYNbMB61bV7LAoghnJow/viewform?usp=sf_link) by end-of-day March 24th.
