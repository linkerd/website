Each divers way along the grisly rock, Horn'd demons I beheld, with lashes huge,
That on their back unmercifully smote. Ah! how they made them bound at the first
stripe!

Hence in the second chasm we heard the ghosts, Who jibber in low melancholy
sounds, With wide-stretch'd nostrils snort, and on themselves Smite with their
palms. Upon the banks a scurf From the foul steam condens'd, encrusting hung,
That held sharp combat with the sight and smell.
