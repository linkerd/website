Next Wednesday is our online July community meetup! Join Oliver, Thomas, Charles and more for a virtual chat about how to get started as a first-time contributor to Linkerd. We'll also have Sergio Méndez joining us to share why he includes Linkerd in his classes at San Carlos University of Guatemala.
