      content: |-
        In a space notorious for complexity, Linkerd is known for one key thing:
        simplicity. While some have given up and accepted complexity as
        inevitable, a few brave souls stand out. If you believe that simplicity
        is not just possible for Kubernetes but necessary; if you are willing to
        stand up to the status quo and reject complexity; if you have empathy
        with the developers who have to use these platforms at the end of the
        day—this is the program for you.

        How Linkerd Ambassadors help educate the community will depend on their
        preferences and strengths. Typically, they must do at least two of the
        following: 

        1. Presenting a Linkerd-related talk at a conference or local meetup,
        2. Create Linkerd-related content (e.g., blog post, video),
        3. Regularly answer questions on Slack (i.e. on a monthly basis),
        4. Contribute code, documentation, or otherwise participate in the
          Linkerd open source project

        Other creative ideas not listed here are also possible, as long as they
        achieve the goal of educating users about Linkerd. Let us know how you
        are achieving it in your application.

        Finally, Ambassadors active on social media are encouraged to help
        amplify Linkerd content on social or other media and engage in
        conversation about Linkerd (e.g., Reddit, LinkedIn, etc.).
