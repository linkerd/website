  overview:
    title: What are Linkerd Ambassadors?
    content: |-
      Linkerd Ambassadors educate the Kubernetes community about Linkerd.
      They spread its message of simplicity far and wide,  and they represent
      the voice of the community back to the Linkerd maintainers. Every
      ambassador works in their own way. While some create content, others may
      prefer to be Community Leaders.
      
      Ambassador activities typically include one or more of the following:

      - **Educate:** Share their knowledge through talks, blog posts, videos,
        meetups, and helping others on the Linkerd Slack.
      - **Foster collaboration:** Build strong relationships within the
        Linkerd community and encourage collaboration.
      - **Grow the community:** Attract and onboard new users to the Linkerd
        ecosystem.
      - **Provide feedback:** Share insights, suggestions, and community
        feedback with Linkerd maintainers to help improve the project.
      - **Promote Linkerd globally:** Spread the word about Linkerd and its
        benefits to a wider audience.

      - title: What are the program requirements?
        content: |-
          How Linkerd Ambassadors help educate the community will depend on their
          preferences and strengths. Typically, they must do at least **two** of
          the following:

          1. Presenting a Linkerd-related talk at a conference or local meetup,
          2. Create Linkerd-related content (e.g., blog post, video),
          3. Regularly answer questions on Slack (i.e. on a monthly basis),
          4. Contribute code, documentation, or otherwise participate in the
            Linkerd open source project
          
          Other creative ideas not listed here are also possible, as long as they
          achieve the goal of educating users about Linkerd. Let us know how you
          are achieving it in your application. 
          
          Finally, Ambassadors active on social media are encouraged to help
          amplify Linkerd content on social or other media and engage in
          conversation about Linkerd (e.g., Reddit, LinkedIn, etc.). 
      - title: What if Linkerd Ambassadors can't fulfill their responsibilities

          Linkerd Ambassadors who opt to step down or are unable to meet
