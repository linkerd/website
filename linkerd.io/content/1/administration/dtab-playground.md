The admin interface also provides a web UI that you can use to help debug
[Dtab]({{% ref "/1/advanced/dtabs.md" %}}) rules that are set up on a running
Linkerd instance. This provides valuable insight into how Linkerd will route
your request. The UI is available at `/delegator`, on the configured admin port.
