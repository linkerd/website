          All our observability gaps were closed, ...we saw a reduction in
          failed requests, and experienced cost reduction due to better
          performance.

          I absolutely love [@Linkerd](https://twitter.com/linkerd) - among
          other things it makes load balancing of grpc service trivial.

          A year ago I switched from Istio to
          [@Linkerd](https://twitter.com/linkerd). Ever since then I never had
          this "...oh maybe that issue is caused by our service mesh" feeling
          again.

          In few hours we are able to tap in our production and staging
          applications logs thanks to [@Linkerd](https://twitter.com/linkerd),
          wonderful slack support also available, solved one issue came in while
          injecting [@Linkerd](https://twitter.com/linkerd), it will help our
          team to see it before client share with us
