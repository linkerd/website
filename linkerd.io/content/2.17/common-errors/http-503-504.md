title: HTTP 503 and 504 Errors
description: HTTP 503 and 504 mean overloaded workloads.
---

503s and 504s show up when a Linkerd proxy is trying to make so many requests to
a workload that it gets overwhelmed.

When the workload next to a proxy makes a request, the proxy adds it to an
internal dispatch queue. When things are going smoothly, the request is pulled
from the queue and dispatched almost immediately. If the queue gets too long,
though (which can generally happen only if the called service is slow to
respond), the proxy will go into _load-shedding_, where any new request gets an
immediate 503. The proxy can only get _out_ of load-shedding when the queue
shrinks.

Failfast also plays a role here: if the proxy puts a service into failfast while
there are requests in the dispatch queue, all the requests in the dispatch queue
get an immediate 504 before the proxy goes into load-shedding.

To get out of failfast, some endpoints for the service have to become available.

To get out of load-shedding, the dispatch queue has to start emptying, which
implies that the service has to get more capacity to process requests or that
the incoming request rate has to drop.
