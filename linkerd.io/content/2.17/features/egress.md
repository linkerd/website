Linkerd features capabilities to monitor and apply policies to egress traffic.
This allows cluster operators to make use of the `EgressNetwork` CRD to classify
and visualize traffic. This CRD can be used as a parent reference for
Gateway API route primitives in order to enable policy and routing configuration.
Linkerd's egress control is implemented in the sidecar proxy itself; separate
egress gateways are not required (though they can be supported).

{{< warning >}}

No service mesh can provide a strong security guarantee about egress traffic
by itself; for example, a malicious actor could bypass the Linkerd sidecar -
and thus Linkerd's egress controls - entirely. Fully restricting egress
traffic in the presence of arbitrary applications thus typically requires a
more comprehensive approach.
