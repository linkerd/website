description = "Protocol detection errors indicate that Linkerd doesn't understand the protocol in use."

Linkerd is capable of proxying all TCP traffic, including TLS connections,
WebSockets, and HTTP tunneling. In most cases where the client speaks first
when a new connection is made, Linkerd can detect the protocol in use,
allowing it to perform per-request routing and metrics.

If your proxy logs contain messages like `protocol detection timed out after
10s`, or you're experiencing 10-second delays when establishing connections,
you're probably running a situation where Linkerd cannot detect the protocol.
This is most common for protocols where the server speaks first, and the
client is waiting for information from the server. It may also occur with
non-HTTP protocols for which Linkerd doesn't yet understand the wire format of
a request.

You'll need to understand exactly what the situation is to fix this:

- A server-speaks-first protocol will probably need to be configured as a
  `skip` or `opaque` port, as described in the [protocol detection
  documentation](../../features/protocol-detection/#configuring-protocol-detection).

- If you're seeing transient protocol detection timeouts, this is more likely
  to indicate a misbehaving workload.

- If you know the protocol is client-speaks-first but you're getting
  consistent protocol detection timeouts, you'll probably need to fall back on
  a `skip` or `opaque` port.

Note that marking ports as `skip` or `opaque` has ramifications beyond
protocol detection timeouts; see the [protocol detection
documentation](../../features/protocol-detection/#configuring-protocol-detection)
for more information.
