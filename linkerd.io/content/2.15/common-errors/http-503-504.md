503s and 504s show up when a Linkerd proxy is trying to make so many
requests to a workload that it gets overwhelmed.

When the workload next to a proxy makes a request, the proxy adds it
to an internal dispatch queue. When things are going smoothly, the
request is pulled from the queue and dispatched almost immediately.
If the queue gets too long, though (which can generally happen only
if the called service is slow to respond), the proxy will go into
_load-shedding_, where any new request gets an immediate 503. The
proxy can only get _out_ of load-shedding when the queue shrinks.

Failfast also plays a role here: if the proxy puts a service into
failfast while there are requests in the dispatch queue, all the
requests in the dispatch queue get an immediate 504 before the
proxy goes into load-shedding.

To get out of failfast, some endpoints for the service have to
become available.

To get out of load-shedding, the dispatch queue has to start
emptying, which implies that the service has to get more capacity
to process requests or that the incoming request rate has to drop.
