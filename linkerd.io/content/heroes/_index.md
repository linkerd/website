  description: Open source is all about community, and Linkerd wouldn't be what it is today without our heroes. Linkerd Heroes contribute to the codebase, help each other out whether on Slack or social media, share their successes and failures at conferences or through blogs, fostering the dynamic and engaging community we all love.
