  title: Linkerd Heroes
  description: Open source is all about community, and Linkerd wouldn't be what it
    is today without our heroes. Linkerd Heroes contribute to the codebase, help each
    other out whether on Slack or social media, share their successes and failures
    at conferences or through blogs, fostering the dynamic and engaging community
    we all love.
