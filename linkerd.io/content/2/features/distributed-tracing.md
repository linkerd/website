Tracing can be an invaluable tool in debugging distributed systems performance,
especially for identifying bottlenecks and understanding the latency cost of
each component in your system. Linkerd can be configured to emit trace spans
from the proxies, allowing you to see exactly what time requests and responses
spend inside.

Unlike most of the features of Linkerd, distributed tracing requires both code
changes and configuration. (You can read up on [Distributed tracing in the
service mesh: four myths](/2019/08/09/service-mesh-distributed-tracing-myths/)
for why this is.)

Furthermore, Linkerd provides many of the features that are often associated
with distributed tracing, *without* requiring configuration or application
changes, including:

* Live service topology and dependency graphs
* Aggregated service health, latencies, and request volumes
* Aggregated path / route health, latencies, and request volumes

For example, Linkerd can display a live topology of all incoming and outgoing
dependencies for a service, without requiring distributed tracing or any other
such application modification:

Likewise, Linkerd can provide golden metrics per service and per *route*, again
without requiring distributed tracing or any other such application
modification:

    title="Linkerd dashboard showing an automatically generated route metrics"

## Using distributed tracing

That said, distributed tracing certainly has its uses, and Linkerd makes this
as easy as it can. Linkerd's role in distributed tracing is actually quite
simple: when a Linkerd data plane proxy sees a tracing header in a proxied HTTP
request, Linkerd will emit a trace span for that request. This span will
include information about the exact amount of time spent in the Linkerd proxy.
When paired with software to collect, store, and analyze this information, this
can provide significant insight into the behavior of the mesh.

To use this feature, you'll also need to introduce several additional
components in your system., including an ingress layer that kicks off the trace
on particular requests, a client library for your application (or a mechanism
to propagate trace headers), a trace collector to collect span data and turn
them into traces, and a trace backend to store the trace data and allow the
user to view/query it.

For details, please see our [guide to adding distributed tracing to your
application with Linkerd](/2/tasks/distributed-tracing/).
