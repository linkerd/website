Linkerd provides some of the features that are often associated with
distributed tracing, including:

* Live service topology and dependency graphs
* Aggregated service health, latencies, and request volumes
* Aggregated path / route health, latencies, and request volumes

These features are provided *automatically*, without requiring changes to the
application or instrumentation with distributed tracing libraries.

For example, Linkerd can display a live topology of all incoming and outgoing
dependencies for a service, without requiring distributed tracing or any other
such application modification:

{{< fig src="/images/books/webapp-detail.png"
    title="The Linkerd dashboard showing an automatically generated topology graph"
>}}

Likewise, Linkerd can provide golden metrics per service and per *route*, again
without requiring distributed tracing or any other such application
modification:

{{< fig src="/images/books/webapp-routes.png"
    title="Linkerd dashboard showing an automatically generated route metrics"
>}}

Of course, if an application *is* instrumented with distributed tracing
libraries, Linkerd does not interfere.

## Future work

In the future, the Linkerd 2.x data plane proxies themselves will also emit
distributed proxy spans (we will "add distributed tracing to Linkerd", at least
for some definition). This will allow proxy data to be incorporated into
traces. However, note that:

* **Caveat 1**: In contrast with practically every other Linkerd feature, taking
  advantage of this feature will require modification of the application code:
  services will need to forward Linkerd span headers. (This is not a limitation
  of Linkerd, simply a consequence of the sidecar model and request concurrency.)
* **Caveat 2**: It is likely that users will want to instrument their application
  with distributed tracing anyways, so that application-level information can
  be incorporated into traces.

We currently recommend that users who require the functionality for which
distributed tracing is necessary (i.e. functionality that is not captured in
the list above) simply instrument their application code with distributed
tracing libraries. In later Linkerd releases, when Linkerd proxies also emit
trace data can be incorporated with additional effort on the part of the
developers.
