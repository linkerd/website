Linkerd can be ran in High Availability or HA mode.

This feature is **experimental** and it's only available in the
[_edge_ release](/2/edge/).

Here's a short description of what `--ha` does to the `linkerd` install.

* Defaults the controller replicas to `3`
* Set's sane `cpu` + `memory` requests to the linkerd control plane components.
* Defaults to a sensible requests for the sidecar containers for the control
  plane + [_auto proxy injection_](/2/features/proxy-injection/).

## Setup

Because it's the control plane that requires the `ha` config, you'll need to
use the `install` command with the `ha` flag.

```bash
linkerd install --ha | kubectl apply -f
```

You can also override the amount of controller replicas that you wish to run by
passing in the `--controller-replicas` flag

```bash
linkerd install --ha --controller-replicas=2 | kubectl apply -f
```
