description = "Linkerd provides mechanisms to programmatically inject failures into services."

Fault injection is a form of chaos engineering where the error rate of a service
is artificially increased to see what impact there is on the system as a whole.
Traditionally, this would require modifying the service's code to add a fault
injection library that would be doing the actual work. Linkerd can do this
without any service code changes, only requiring a little configuration.

To inject faults into your own services, follow the [tutorial](/2/tasks/fault-injection/).
