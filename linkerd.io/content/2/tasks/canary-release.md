Linkerd's [traffic split](/2/features/traffic-split/) feature allows you to
dynamically shift traffic between services. This can be used to implement
lower-risk  deployment strategies like blue-green deploys and canaries.

But simply shifting traffic from one version of a service to the next is just
the beginning. We can combine traffic splitting with [Linkerd's automatic
*golden metrics* telemetry](/2/features/telemetry/) and drive traffic decisions
based on the observed metrics. For example, we can gradually shift traffic from
an old deployment to a new one while continually monitoring its success rate. If
at any point the success rate drops, we can shift traffic back to the original
deployment and back out of the release. Ideally, our users remain happy
throughout, not noticing a thing!

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through how to combine Linkerd with
[Flagger](https://flagger.app/), a progressive delivery tool that ties
Linkerd's metrics and traffic splitting together in a control loop,
allowing for fully-automated, metrics-aware canary deployments.

## Prerequisites

- To use this guide, you'll need to have Linkerd installed on your cluster.
  Follow the [Installing Linkerd Guide](/2/tasks/install/) if you haven't
  already done this.
- The installation of Flagger depends on `kubectl` 1.14 or newer.

## Install Flagger

While Linkerd will be managing the actual traffic routing, Flagger automates
the process of creating new Kubernetes resources, watching metrics and
incrementally sending users over to the new version. To add Flagger to your
cluster and have it configured to work with Linkerd, run:

```bash
kubectl apply -k github.com/weaveworks/flagger/kustomize/linkerd
```

This command adds:

- The canary
  [CRD](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)
  that enables configuring how a rollout should occur.
- RBAC which grants Flagger permissions to modify all the resources that it
  needs to, such as deployments and services.
- A controller configured to interact with the Linkerd control plane.

To watch until everything is up and running, you can use `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl -n linkerd rollout status deploy/flagger
```

## Set up the demo

This demo consists of two components: a load generator and a deployment. The
deployment creates a pod that returns some information such as name. You can use
the responses to watch the incremental rollout as Flagger orchestrates it. A
load generator simply makes it easier to execute the rollout as there needs to
be some kind of active traffic to complete the operation. Together, these
components have a topology that looks like:

{{< fig src="/images/canary/simple-topology.svg"
        title="Topology" >}}

To add these components to your cluster and include them in the Linkerd
[data plane](/2/reference/architecture/#data-plane), run:

```bash
kubectl create ns test && \
  kubectl apply -f https://run.linkerd.io/flagger.yml
```

Verify that everything has started up successfully by running:

```bash
kubectl -n test rollout status deploy podinfo
```

Check it out by forwarding the service locally and opening
[http://localhost:9898](http://localhost:9898) locally by running:

```bash
kubectl -n test port-forward svc/podinfo 9898
```

{{< note >}}
Traffic shifting occurs on the *client* side of the connection and not the
server side. Any requests coming from outside the mesh will not be shifted and
will always be directed to the primary backend. A service of type `LoadBalancer`
will exhibit this behavior as the source is not part of the mesh. To shift
external traffic, add your ingress controller to the mesh.
{{< /note>}}

## Configure the release

Before changing anything, you need to configure how a release should be rolled
out on the cluster. The configuration is contained in a
[Canary](https://docs.flagger.app/tutorials/linkerd-progressive-delivery)
definition. To apply to your cluster, run:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: flagger.app/v1beta1
kind: Canary
metadata:
  name: podinfo
  namespace: test
spec:
  targetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: podinfo
  service:
    port: 9898
  analysis:
    interval: 10s
    threshold: 5
    stepWeight: 10
    maxWeight: 100
    metrics:
    - name: request-success-rate
      thresholdRange:
        min: 99
      interval: 1m
    - name: request-duration
      thresholdRange:
        max: 500
      interval: 1m
EOF
```

The Flagger controller is watching these definitions and will create some new
resources on your cluster. To watch as this happens, run:

```bash
kubectl -n test get ev --watch
```

A new deployment named `podinfo-primary` will be created with the same number of
replicas that `podinfo` has. Once the new pods are ready, the original
deployment is scaled down to zero. This provides a deployment that is managed by
Flagger as an implementation detail and maintains your original configuration
files and workflows. Once you see the following line, everything is setup:

```bash
0s          Normal    Synced                   canary/podinfo                          Initialization done! podinfo.test
```

In addition to a managed deployment, there are also services created to
orchestrate routing traffic between the new and old versions of your
application. These can be viewed with `kubectl -n test get svc` and should look
like:

```bash
NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
frontend             ClusterIP   10.7.251.33   <none>        8080/TCP   96m
podinfo              ClusterIP   10.7.252.86   <none>        9898/TCP   96m
podinfo-canary       ClusterIP   10.7.245.17   <none>        9898/TCP   23m
podinfo-primary      ClusterIP   10.7.249.63   <none>        9898/TCP   23m
```

At this point, the topology looks a little like:

        title="Initialized" >}}

{{< note >}}
This guide barely touches all the functionality provided by Flagger. Make sure
to read the [documentation](https://docs.flagger.app/) if you're interested in
combining canary releases with HPA, working off custom metrics or doing other
types of releases such as A/B testing.

## Start the rollout

As a system, Kubernetes resources have two major sections: the spec and status.
When a controller sees a spec, it tries as hard as it can to make the status of
the current system match the spec. With a deployment, if any of the pod spec
configuration is  changed, a controller will kick off a rollout. By default, the
deployment controller will orchestrate a [rolling
update](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/update/update-intro/).

In this example, Flagger will notice that a deployment's spec changed and start
orchestrating the canary rollout. To kick this process off, you can update the
image to a new version by running:

```bash
kubectl -n test set image deployment/podinfo \
  podinfod=quay.io/stefanprodan/podinfo:1.7.1
```

Any kind of modification to the pod's spec such as updating an environment
variable or annotation would result in the same behavior as updating the image.

On update, the canary deployment (`podinfo`) will be scaled up. Once ready,
Flagger will begin to update the [TrafficSplit CRD](/2/features/traffic-split/)
incrementally. With a configured stepWeight of 10, each increment will increase
the weight of `podinfo` by 10. For each period, the success rate will be
observed and as long as it is over the threshold of 99%, Flagger will continue
the rollout. To watch this entire process, run:

```bash
kubectl -n test get ev --watch
```

While an update is occurring, the resources and traffic will look like this at a
high level:

{{< fig src="/images/canary/ongoing.svg"
        title="Ongoing" >}}

After the update is complete, this picture will go back to looking just like the
figure from the previous section.

{{< note >}}
You can toggle the image tag between `1.7.1` and `1.7.0` to start the rollout
again.
{{< /note >}}

### Resource

The canary resource updates with the current status and progress. You can watch
by running:

```bash
watch kubectl -n test get canary
```

Behind the scenes, Flagger is splitting traffic between the primary and canary
backends by updating the traffic split resource. To watch how this configuration
changes over the rollout, run:

```bash
kubectl -n test get trafficsplit podinfo -o yaml
```

Each increment will increase the weight of `podinfo-canary` and decrease the
weight of `podinfo-primary`. Once the rollout is successful, the weight of
`podinfo-primary` will be set back to 100 and the underlying canary deployment
(`podinfo`) will be scaled down.

### Metrics

As traffic shifts from the primary deployment to the canary one, Linkerd
provides visibility into what is happening to the destination of requests. The
metrics show the backends receiving traffic in real time and measure the success
rate, latencies and throughput. From the CLI, you can watch this by running:

```bash
watch linkerd -n test stat deploy --from deploy/load
```

For something a little more visual, you can use the dashboard. Start it by
running `linkerd dashboard` and then look at the detail page for the [podinfo
traffic split](http://localhost:50750/namespaces/test/trafficsplits/podinfo).

{{< fig src="/images/canary/traffic-split.png"
        title="Dashboard" >}}

### Browser

To see the landing page served by `podinfo`, run:

```bash
kubectl -n test port-forward svc/frontend 8080
```

This will make the podinfo landing page available at
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Refreshing the page will show
toggling between the new version and a different header color. Alternatively,
running `curl http://localhost:8080` will return a JSON response that looks
something like:

```bash
{
  "hostname": "podinfo-primary-74459c7db8-lbtxf",
  "version": "1.7.0",
  "revision": "4fc593f42c7cd2e7319c83f6bfd3743c05523883",
  "color": "blue",
  "message": "greetings from podinfo v1.7.0",
  "goos": "linux",
  "goarch": "amd64",
  "runtime": "go1.11.2",
  "num_goroutine": "6",
  "num_cpu": "8"
}
```

This response will slowly change as the rollout continues.

## Cleanup

To cleanup, remove the Flagger controller from your cluster and delete the
`test` namespace by running:

```bash
kubectl delete -k github.com/weaveworks/flagger/kustomize/linkerd && \
  kubectl delete ns test
```
