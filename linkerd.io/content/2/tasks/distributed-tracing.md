Using distributed tracing in practice can be complex. In this guide, we've
assembled a recommendation on the best way to make use of distributed tracing
with Linkerd.

## Context

First, let's understand what exactly "distributed tracing support" looks like
in Linkerd. It's actually quite simple: when a Linkerd data plane proxy sees a
tracing header in **b3** format in a proxied HTTP request (see below for why
this particular format), Linkerd will emit a trace span for that request. This
span will include information about the exact amount of time spent in the
Linkerd proxy, and, in the future, potentially other information as well.

And that's it. As you can see, Linkerd's role in distributed tracing is
actually quite simple. The complexity lies in everything else that must be in
place in order to make this feature of Linkerd useful.

What else is required? To use Linkerd's new distributed tracing feature, you'll
need several additional components in your system:

1. An ingress layer that kicks off the trace on particular requests.
1. A client library for your application. (Your application code must propagate
  trace headers, and ideally emit its own spans as well.)
1. A trace collector to collect span data and turn them into traces.
1. A trace backend to store the trace data and allow the user to view/query it.

## Quickstart demo

Let's dive in to how distributed tracing works with a working example. Then
we'll describe each of the components in more detail and explain how to use
those components in your own application.

First, make sure you've [installed Linkerd](/2/tasks/install/) version 2.6 or
later.

```bash
$ linkerd version
Client version: stable-2.6
Server version: stable-2.6
```

Start by cloning the reference architecture repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:adleong/emojivoto.git && \
  cd emojivoto
```

Next, install Jaeger and the OpenCensus collector. It's important to inject
these components with Linkerd so that they can receive spans from the Linkerd
proxy over a secure connection.

```bash
linkerd inject tracing.yml | kubectl apply -f -
```

Finally, install the NGINX ingress controller and the Emojivoto application
itself. Since we inject these components with Linkerd, we will be able to see
the Linkerd proxy itself in the resulting traces.

```bash
linkerd inject emojivoto.yml | kubectl apply -f - && \
  linkerd inject ingress.yml | kubectl apply -f -
```

With all of that in place, we can finally use the Jaeger dashboard to explore
traces flowing through the system.

```bash
kubectl -n tracing port-forward deploy/jaeger 16686 &; \
  open http://localhost:16686
```

Congrats! You have a functioning distributed tracing system with Linkerd.

## Details

The architecture in this guide has four components: NGINX for ingress,
OpenCensus for the client library, OpenCensus for the trace collector, and
Jaeger for the backend. We'll describe each of these components in more detail.
Of course, each of these components is swappable--we've detailed the
requirements for substituting a different option for each component below.

## Ingress: NGINX

The ingress is an especially important component for distributed tracing because
it creates the root span of each trace and is responsible for deciding if that
trace should be sampled or not. Having the ingress make all sampling decisions
ensures that either an entire trace is sampled or none of it is, and avoids
creating "partial traces".

Distributed tracing systems all rely on services to propagate metadata about the
current trace from requests that they receive to requests that they send. This
metadata, called the trace context, is usually encoded in one or more request
headers. There are many different trace context header formats and while we hope
that the ecosystem will eventually converge on open standards like [W3C
tracecontext](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/), we only use the [b3
format](https://github.com/openzipkin/b3-propagation) today. Being one of the
earliest widely used formats, it has the widest support, especially among
ingresses like NGINX.

This reference architecture includes a simple NGINX config that samples 50% of
traces and emits trace data to the collector (using the Zipkin protocol). Any
ingress controller can be used here in place of NGINX as long as it:

- Supports probabilistic sampling
- Encodes trace context in the b3 format
- Emits spans in a protocol supported by the OpenCensus collector

## Client library: OpenCensus

While it is possible for services to manually propagate trace propagation
headers, it's usually much easier to use a library which does three things:

- Propagates the trace context from incoming request headers to outgoing
  request headers
- Modifies the trace context (i.e. starts a new span)
- Transmits this data to a trace collector

We recommend using OpenCensus in your service and configuring it with:

- [b3 propagation](https://github.com/openzipkin/b3-propagation) (this is the default)
- [the OpenCensus agent
  exporter](https://opencensus.io/exporters/supported-exporters/go/ocagent/)

The OpenCensus agent exporter will export trace data to the OpenCensus collector
over a gRPC API. The details of how to configure OpenCensus will vary language
by language, but there are [guides for many popular
languages](https://opencensus.io/quickstart/). You can also see an end-to-end
example of this in Go with our example application,
[Emojivoto](https://github.com/adleong/emojivoto).

You may notice that the OpenCensus project is in maintenance mode and will
become part of [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/). Unfortunately,
OpenTelemetry is not yet production ready and so OpenCensus remains our
recommendation for the moment.

## Collector: OpenCensus

The OpenCensus collector receives trace data from the OpenCensus agent exporter
and potentially does translation and filtering before sending that data to
Jaeger. Having the OpenCensus exporter send to the OpenCensus collector gives us
a lot of flexibility: we can switch to any backend that OpenCensus supports
without needing to interrupt the application.

## Backend: Jaeger

Jaeger is one of the most widely used tracing backends and for good reason: it
is easy to use and does a great job of visualizing traces. However, [any
backend supported by OpenCensus](https://opencensus.io/service/exporters/) can
be used instead.

## Linkerd

If your application is injected with Linkerd, the Linkerd proxy will
participate in the traces and will also emit trace data to the OpenCensus
collector. This enriches the trace data and allows you to see exactly how much
time requests are spending in the proxy and on the wire. To enable Linkerd's
participation:

- Set the `config.linkerd.io/trace-collector` annotation on the namespace or pod
 specs that you want to participate in traces. This should be set to the
 address of the OpenCensus collector service. In our reference architecture
 this is `oc-collector.tracing:55678`.
- Set the `config.alpha.linkerd.io/trace-collector-service-account` annotation
 on the namespace of pod specs that you want to participate in traces. This
 should be set to the name of the service account of the collector and is used
 to ensure secure communication between the proxy and the collector. This can
 be omitted if the collector is running as the default service account. This is
 the case for the reference architecture so we omit it.
- Ensure the pods that you want to emit spans are injected with the Linkerd
 proxy.
- Ensure the OpenCensus collector is injected with the Linkerd proxy.

While Linkerd can only actively participate in traces that use the **b3**
propagation format (as in the reference architecture above), Linkerd will
always forward unknown request headers transparently, which means it will never
interfere with traces that use other propagation formats. We would also love to
expand Linkerd's support for more propagation formats. Please open an
[issue](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/issues) (or [pull
request](https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/pulls)!) if this interests you.

## Conclusion

Hopefully this guide makes it easier for you to understand the different moving
parts of distributed tracing and to get started instrumenting your application.
While this isn't the only way to get distributed tracing for your application,
we'd hope it represents a good starting point for your exploration.
