In order for your service to take advantage of Linkerd, it needs to have the
proxy sidecar added to its resource definition. This is done by using the
Linkerd [CLI](/2/reference/architecture/#cli) to update the definition
and output YAML that can be passed to `kubectl`. By using Kubernetes' rolling
updates, the availability of your application will not be affected.

To add Linkerd to your service, run:

```bash
linkerd inject deployment.yml \
  | kubectl apply -f -
```

`deployment.yml` is the Kubernetes config file containing your
application. This will add the proxy sidecar along with an `initContainer` that
configures iptables to pass all traffic through the proxy. By applying this new
configuration via `kubectl`, a rolling update of your deployment will be
triggered replacing each pod with a new one.

You will know that your service has been successfully added to the service mesh
if it's pods are reported to be meshed in the Meshed column of the Linkerd
dashboard.

You can always get to the Linkerd dashboard by running:

```bash
linkerd dashboard
```
