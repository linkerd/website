Linkerd can optionally be installed via Helm rather than with the `linkerd
install` command.

## Prerequisite: identity certificates

The identity component of Linkerd requires setting up a trust anchor
certificate, and an issuer certificate with its key. These must use the ECDSA
P-256 algorithm and need to be provided to Helm by the user (unlike when using
the `linkerd install` CLI which can generate these automatically). You can
provide your own, or follow [these instructions](/2/tasks/generate-certificates/)
to generate new ones.

## Adding Linkerd's Helm repository

```bash
# To add the repo for Linkerd2 stable releases:
helm repo add linkerd https://helm.linkerd.io/stable

# To add the repo for Linkerd2 edge releases:
helm repo add linkerd-edge https://helm.linkerd.io/edge
```

The following instructions use the `linkerd` repo. For installing an edge
release, just replace with `linkerd-edge`.

## Helm install procedure

```bash
# set expiry date one year from now, in Mac:
exp=$(date -v+8760H +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
# in Linux:
exp=$(date -d '+8760 hour' +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")

helm install linkerd2 \
  --set-file global.identityTrustAnchorsPEM=ca.crt \
  --set-file identity.issuer.tls.crtPEM=issuer.crt \
  --set-file identity.issuer.tls.keyPEM=issuer.key \
  --set identity.issuer.crtExpiry=$exp \
  linkerd/linkerd2
```

{{< note >}}
For Helm versions < v3, `--name` flag has to specifically be passed.
In Helm v3, It has been deprecated, and is the first argument as
 specified above.
{{< /note >}}

The chart values will be picked from the chart's `values.yaml` file.

You can override the values in that file by providing your own `values.yaml`
file passed with a `-f` option, or overriding specific values using the family of
`--set` flags like we did above for certificates.

## Disabling The Proxy Init Container

If installing with CNI, make sure that you add the `--set
global.cniEnabled=true` flag to your `helm install` command.

## Setting High-Availability

The chart contains a file `values-ha.yaml` that overrides some
default values as to set things up under a high-availability scenario, analogous
to the `--ha` option in `linkerd install`. Values such as higher number of
replicas, higher memory/cpu limits and affinities are specified in that file.

You can get ahold of `values-ha.yaml` by fetching the chart files:

```bash
helm fetch --untar linkerd/linkerd2
```

Then use the `-f` flag to provide the override file, for example:

```bash
## see above on how to set $exp
helm install linkerd2 \
  --set-file global.identityTrustAnchorsPEM=ca.crt \
  --set-file identity.issuer.tls.crtPEM=issuer.crt \
  --set-file identity.issuer.tls.keyPEM=issuer.key \
  --set identity.issuer.crtExpiry=$exp \
  -f linkerd2/values-ha.yaml \
  linkerd/linkerd2
```

## Customizing the Namespace

To install Linkerd to a different namespace than the default `linkerd`,
override the `Namespace` variable.

By default, the chart creates the control plane namespace with the
`config.linkerd.io/admission-webhooks: disabled` label. It is required for the
control plane to work correctly. This means that the chart won't work with
Helm v2's `--namespace` option.  If you're relying on a separate tool to create
the control plane namespace, make sure that:

1. The namespace is labeled with `config.linkerd.io/admission-webhooks: disabled`
1. The `installNamespace` is set to `false`
1. The `namespace` variable is overridden with the name of your namespace

{{< note >}}
In Helm v3 the `--namespace` option must be used with an existing namespace.

## Helm upgrade procedure

Make sure your local Helm repos are updated:

```bash
helm repo update

helm search linkerd2 -v {{% latestversion %}}
NAME                    CHART VERSION          APP VERSION            DESCRIPTION
linkerd/linkerd2        <chart-semver-version> {{% latestversion %}}    Linkerd gives you observability, reliability, and securit...
```

The `helm upgrade` command has a number of flags that allow you to customize
its behaviour. The ones that special attention should be paid to are
`--reuse-values` and `--reset-values` and how they behave when charts change
from version to version and/or overrides are applied through `--set` and
`--set-file`. To summarize there are the following prominent cases that can be
observed:

- `--reuse-values` with no overrides - all values are reused
- `--reuse-values` with overrides - all except the values that are overridden
are reused
- `--reset-values` with no overrides - no values are reused and all changes
from provided release are applied during the upgrade
- `--reset-values` with overrides - no values are reused and changed from
provided release are applied together with the overrides
- no flag and no overrides - `--reuse-values` will be used by default
- no flag and overrides - `--reset-values` will be used by default

Bearing all that in mind, you have to decide whether you want to reuse the
values in the chart or move to the values specified in the newer chart.
The advised practice is to use a `values.yaml` file that stores all custom
overrides that you have for your chart. Before upgrade, check whether there
are breaking changes to the chart (i.e. renamed or moved keys, etc). You can
consult the [edge](https://hub.helm.sh/charts/linkerd2-edge/linkerd2) or the
[stable](https://hub.helm.sh/charts/linkerd2/linkerd2) chart docs, depending on
which one your are upgrading to. If there are, make the corresponding changes to
your `values.yaml` file. Then you can use:

```bash
helm upgrade linkerd2 linkerd/linkerd2 --reset-values -f values.yaml --atomic
```

The `--atomic` flag will ensure that all changes are rolled back in case the
upgrade operation fails
