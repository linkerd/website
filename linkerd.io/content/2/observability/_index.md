Linkerd provides extensive observability functionality. It automatically
instruments top-line metrics such as request volume, success rates, and latency
distributions. In addition to these top-line metrics, Linkerd provides real time
streams of the requests for all incoming and outgoing traffic.

To help visualize all this data, there is a [CLI](../architecture/#cli),
[dashboard](../architecture/#dashboard) and out of the box
[Grafana dashboards](../architecture/#grafana).

Some deep dive topics on metrics:
