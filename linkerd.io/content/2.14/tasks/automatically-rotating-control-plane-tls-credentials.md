title: Automatically Rotating Control Plane TLS Credentials
description: Use cert-manager to automatically rotate control plane TLS credentials.
---

Linkerd's [automatic mTLS](../../features/automatic-mtls/), like any TLS
implementation, relies on properly-configured _certificates_ as the basis of
identity within the mesh. Each meshed workload has its own _workload
certificate_ generated by Linkerd itself based on a *trust anchor*, which can
be shared across clusters, and an *identity issuer certificate*, which is
specific to the cluster.

{{< note >}}

Certificates are one of the most important parts of a secure system based on
mTLS, but they are also commonly one of the least well documented. For more
information about certificates in Linkerd, see the Buoyant [(m)TLS concepts
primer][mtls-concepts-primer].

[mtls-concepts-primer]: https://docs.buoyant.io/primers/tls-concepts/

{{< /note >}}

While Linkerd automatically rotates the workload certificates, it cannot
automatically rotate the identity issuer certificate or the trust anchor.
Linkerd's out-of-the-box installations generate static self-signed
certificates with a validity of one year but require manual rotation by the
user to prevent expiry. While this setup is convenient for quick start
testing, it's not advisable nor recommended for production environments.

## Automating Certificate Management with cert-manager and trust-manager

[cert-manager] and [trust-manager] are popular CNCF tools that automate
certificate management for Kubernetes installations. They can work together
with Linkerd to automate rotating the identity issuer certificate and partly
automate rotating the trust anchor.

[cert-manager]: https://cert-manager.io/docs/
[trust-manager]: https://cert-manager.io/docs/trust/trust-manager/

cert-manager is _extremely_ flexible, and much of its configuration depends on
the specific policies of the organization running it. Rather than attempt to
provide a comprehensive guide to cert-manager, this document will focus on a
very simple setup:

- **cert-manager will create a self-signed trust anchor.**

  Since the trust anchor is a self-signed certificate, its private key is
  stored _in the cluster_ (specifically, in a Kubernetes Secret in the
  `cert-manager` namespace). It would be more secure to keep the trust
  anchor's private key off the cluster entirely, since Linkerd never needs
  access to it; we'll discuss that a bit more in the [trust anchor
  setup](#3-configure-cert-manager-to-create-the-trust-anchor) section.

- **cert-manager will use the trust anchor to create Linkerd's identity issuer
  certificate.**

  The identity issuer certificate's private key is also stored in the cluster
  (in a Secret in the `linkerd` namespace). Linkerd _does_ need access to
  this private key; this is the only way to manage the identity issuer.

- **Finally, trust-manager will create a _trust bundle_ that Linkerd will use
  to verify the authenticity of certificates issued by cert-manager.**

  The trust bundle doesn't contain any private keys at all. It will be stored
  in a ConfigMap in the `linkerd` namespace.

Once the certificates are created, cert-manager will automatically rotate the
identity issuer certificate as necessary. Rotating the trust anchor is a bit
more complex: though cert-manager can do the heavy lifting for you, the
rotation will still involve manual intervention, as explained below.

{{< note >}}

cert-manager is _extremely_ flexible, with many different ways to configure
it. For more information about cert-manager in general and how to approach its
configuration, see Buoyant's [cert-manager concepts primer].

## Setup Overview

The process we will follow is straightforward even though it has several
steps:

1. Create the `linkerd` namespace in which we need our Linkerd certificates to
   live
2. Install cert-manager and trust-manager on your cluster
3. Configure cert-manager to create the trust anchor
4. Configure cert-manager to create the identity issuer certificate
5. Configure cert-manager to create a trust bundle for Linkerd to use
6. Install Linkerd using certificates created by cert-manager
7. Check everything that cert-manager did!
8. Rotating the identity issuer
9. Rotating the trust anchor

### 1. Create the `linkerd` namespace

This may seem a bit odd, since we haven't installed Linkerd yet! However, this
is an important first step: Linkerd expects its certificates to be in the
`linkerd` namespace, and when working with cert-manager, Linkerd needs the
certificates to already be present when it is installed. So we'll create the
namespace now:

```bash
kubectl create namespace linkerd
```

### 2. Install cert-manager and trust-manager

[cert-manager installation guide]: https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/
[trust-manager installation guide]: https://cert-manager.io/docs/trust/trust-manager/installation/

Next up, install cert-manager (we'll use Helm for this, but you can check out
the [cert-manager installation guide] for more options):

```bash
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io --force-update

helm install \
  cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
  --namespace cert-manager \
  --create-namespace \
  --set crds.enabled=true

kubectl rollout status -n cert-manager deploy
```

We strongly recommend installing cert-manager in the `cert-manager` namespace.

Once cert-manager is installed, install trust-manager (again, we'll use Helm
for this, but there are more options in the [trust-manager installation
guide]). We'll install trust-manager in the `cert-manager` namespace as well,
and we'll also configure trust-manager to use the `cert-manager` namespace as
its _trust namespace_. The trust namespace is the only namespace from which
trust-manager is allowed to read Secrets: since we want trust-manager to look
at Secrets for the certificates that cert-manager is creating, the
`cert-manager` namespace is the one we want.

```bash
helm install \
  trust-manager jetstack/trust-manager \
  --namespace cert-manager \
  --set app.trust.namespace=cert-manager \
  --wait
```

Finally, we'll need to update cert-manager's RBAC permissions.  By default
cert-manager will only create certificate secrets in the namespace where it is
installed. Linkerd, however, requires its identity issuer to be created in the
`linkerd` namespace. To allow this, we create a `ServiceAccount` for
cert-manager in the `linkerd` namespace with the required permissions.

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: cert-manager
  namespace: linkerd
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: cert-manager-secret-creator
  namespace: linkerd
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["secrets"]
    verbs: ["create", "get", "update", "patch"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: cert-manager-secret-creator-binding
  namespace: linkerd
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: cert-manager
    namespace: linkerd
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: cert-manager-secret-creator
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
EOF
```

### 3. Configure cert-manager to create the trust anchor

As described in Buoyant's [cert-manager concepts primer], cert-manager uses
_issuers_ to create _certificates_. Any certificate created and managed by
cert-manager must be configured with a Certificate resource and must be linked
to an issuer. Any issuer that cert-manager uses must be configured with an
Issuer or ClusterIssuer resource.

The main difference between an Issuer and a ClusterIssuer is that Issuers can
only be used by Certificates in the same namespace as the Issuer, while
ClusterIssuers can cross namespaces. For the trust anchor, we'll use an Issuer
in the `cert-manager` namespace. This will be a self-signed issuer, meaning
that will simply generate self-signed certificates with random keys -- this is
the simplest kind of issuer.

{{< note >}}

As described above, the self-signed issuer isn't the most secure way to do
things. It's better to keep the trust anchor's private key off the cluster
entirely, and in fact many organizations make this a hard requirement.

If you're in this situation where the self-signed issuer isn't a good fit for
you, you may be able to adapt the setup to your needs simply by using a
different kind of issuer to provide Linkerd's trust anchor, but if you're
serious about keeping the trust anchor's private key off the cluster entirely,
you'll probably need to change the issuer for the identity issuer as well. The
issuers we show here are just examples: it's fine to edit them for your world.
Just be careful about namespaces! if your issuer isn't in the `cert-manager`
namespace, you might need to make some extra changes.

{{< /note >}}

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  # This is the name of the Issuer resource; it's the way
  # Certificate resources can find this issuer.
  name: linkerd-trust-root-issuer
  namespace: cert-manager
spec:
  selfSigned: {}
EOF
```

Next, we'll create a cert-manager `Certificate` resource which uses the
previously-created `Issuer`.

{{< warning >}}

See the warning below about the `rotationPolicy` for this Certificate.

{{< /warning >}}

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  # This is the name of the Certificate resource, but the Secret
  # we save the certificate into can be different.
  name: linkerd-trust-anchor
  namespace: cert-manager
spec:
  # This tells cert-manager which issuer to use for this Certificate:
  # in this case, the Issuer named linkerd-trust-root-issuer.
  issuerRef:
    kind: Issuer
    name: linkerd-trust-root-issuer

  # The issued certificate will be saved in this Secret
  secretName: linkerd-trust-anchor

  # These are details about the certificate to be issued: check
  # out the cert-manager docs for more, but realize that setting
  # the private key's rotationPolicy to Always is _very_ important,
  # and that for Linkerd you _must_ set isCA to true!
  isCA: true
  commonName: root.linkerd.cluster.local
  # This is a one-year duration, rotating two months before expiry.
  # Feel free to reduce this, but remember that there is a manual
  # process for rotating the trust anchor!
  duration: 8760h0m0s
  renewBefore: 7320h0m0s
  privateKey:
    rotationPolicy: Always
    algorithm: ECDSA
EOF
```

{{< warning >}}

If you do not set `rotationPolicy: Always` in the Certificate's `privateKey`
section, cert-manager **will not** actually rotate the trust anchor: instead,
it will update the validity timestamps but **not** generate a new private key.
**This is definitely not as secure as rotating the private key**; we recommend
always setting `rotationPolicy: Always` for any certificate that cert-manager
is managing.

{{< /warning >}}

Note that this Certificate lives in the `cert-manager` namespace with the
`linkerd-trust-root-issuer` Issuer. cert-manager will write the newly-created
certificate into a Secret with the name given by the `secretName` field, in
the same namespace as the Certificate. While Linkerd needs its trust bundle to
be in the `linkerd` namespace, Linkerd does _not_ need access to the private
key of the trust anchor, so it's better to keep that Secret in the
`cert-manager` namespace where Linkerd can be prevented from accessing it.

At this point, you should see a Secret named `linkerd-trust-anchor` in the
`cert-manager` namespace:

```bash
kubectl get secret -n cert-manager linkerd-trust-anchor
```

### 4. Configure cert-manager to create the identity issuer certificate

We now need to configure cert-manager to create the Linkerd identity issuer
certificate, which requires creating another issuer. For this, we'll use a
`CA`-type ClusterIssuer, since we're going to want cert-manager to use the
trust anchor certificate it just created to issue a second certificate.

This needs to be a ClusterIssuer because Linkerd _does_ need access to the
private key of the identity issuer certificate, so its Certificate needs to be
in the `linkerd` namespace. Using a ClusterIssuer is the simplest way to cross
namespace boundaries here.

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  # This is the name of the Issuer resource; it's the way
  # Certificate resources can find this issuer.
  name: linkerd-identity-issuer
  namespace: cert-manager
spec:
  ca:
    secretName: linkerd-trust-anchor
EOF
```

{{< note >}}

Again, if you've changed things such that the trust anchor's private key isn't
on the cluster all, you'll probably need to switch to a different kind of
issuer here -- the `CA` issuer won't work without access to a private key.

{{< /note >}}

Next we'll create a Certificate resource which uses the
`linkerd-identity-issuer` ClusterIssuer to create the Linkerd identity issuer
certificate. Linkerd will use this certificate to issue workload certificates
to all the Linkerd proxies in the system, so although this Certificate will
reference the ClusterIssuer we just created in the `cert-manager` namespace,
the Certificate itself _must_ be in the `linkerd` namespace.

{{< warning >}}

See the warning below about the `rotationPolicy` for this Certificate.

{{< /warning >}}

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  # This is the name of the Certificate resource, but the Secret
  # we save the certificate into can be different.
  name: linkerd-identity-issuer
  namespace: linkerd
spec:
  # This tells cert-manager which issuer to use for this Certificate:
  # in this case, the ClusterIssuer named linkerd-identity-issuer.
  issuerRef:
    name: linkerd-identity-issuer
    kind: ClusterIssuer

  # The issued certificate will be saved in this Secret.
  secretName: linkerd-identity-issuer

  # These are details about the certificate to be issued: check
  # out the cert-manager docs for more, but realize that setting
  # the private key's rotationPolicy to Always is _very_ important,
  # and that for Linkerd you _must_ set isCA to true!
  isCA: true
  commonName: identity.linkerd.cluster.local
  # This is a two-day duration, rotating slightly over a day before
  # expiry. Feel free to set this as you like.
  duration: 48h0m0s
  renewBefore: 25h0m0s
  privateKey:
    rotationPolicy: Always
    algorithm: ECDSA
EOF
```

{{< warning >}}

If you do not set `rotationPolicy: Always` in the Certificate's `privateKey`
section, cert-manager **will not** actually rotate the trust anchor: instead,
it will update the validity timestamps but **not** generate a new private key.
**This is definitely not as secure as rotating the private key**; we recommend
always setting `rotationPolicy: Always` for any certificate that cert-manager
is managing.

{{< /warning >}}

At this point, you should see a Secret named `linkerd-identity-issuer` in the
`linkerd` namespace:

```bash
kubectl get secret -n linkerd linkerd-identity-issuer
```

### 5. Configure cert-manager to create a trust bundle for Linkerd to use

Almost done! We only need one more thing: the _trust bundle_ will lets Linkerd
know which trust anchors to accept. We'll use trust-manager for this, but
there's a catch: when rotating the trust anchor, both the control plane and
the data plane (the proxies) need to be restarted. Since that can't happen
instaneously, we need to have both the old trust anchor and the new trust
anchor in the trust bundle until all the restarts have completed.

trust-manager can do this, but it needs a specific source for _each_
certificate in the bundle. So we'll start by copying the trust anchor from the
`linkerd-trust-anchor` Secret into a second Secret, `linkerd-previous-anchor`,
and then we'll configure trust-manager to use both Secrets as sources for the
trust bundle.

{{< note >}}

If you're keeping the trust anchor's private key off the cluster entirely, the
trust anchor might be stored in some resource other than a Secret. In that
case, you'll need to modify this command to do the right thing for your
resource type.

{{< /note >}}

```bash
kubectl get secret -n cert-manager linkerd-trust-anchor -o yaml \
        | sed -e s/linkerd-trust-anchor/linkerd-previous-anchor/ \
        | egrep -v '^  *(resourceVersion|uid)' \
        | kubectl apply -f -
```

This way, when cert-manager rotates the trust anchor and updates the
`linkerd-trust-anchor` Secret, trust-manager will take the new anchor from the
`linkerd-trust-anchor` Secret and the previous anchor from the
`linkerd-previous-anchor` Secret, bundle them together, and save the bundle in
a ConfigMap. After everything is restarted, we'll copy the new trust anchor
across to the `linkerd-previous-anchor` Secret, and since both Secrets are
identical, the ConfigMap will only contain a single anchor in a bundle.

Once that's done, we can create the Bundle resource to tell trust-manager how
to build the trust bundle.

{{< note >}}

**The Bundle resource works differently than the Certificate resource.** In
particular, the Bundle name _must_ match the ConfigMap to be created.

{{< /note >}}

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
---
apiVersion: trust.cert-manager.io/v1alpha1
kind: Bundle
metadata:
  # This is the name of the Bundle and _also_ the name of the
  # ConfigMap in which we'll write the trust bundle.
  name: linkerd-identity-trust-roots
  namespace: linkerd
spec:
  # This tells trust-manager where to find the public keys to copy into
  # the trust bundle.
  sources:
    # This is the Secret that cert-manager will update when it rotates
    # the trust anchor.
    - secret:
        name: "linkerd-trust-anchor"
        key: "tls.crt"

    # This is the Secret that we will use to hold the previous trust
    # anchor; we'll manually update this Secret after we're finished
    # restarting things.
    - secret:
        name: "linkerd-previous-anchor"
        key: "tls.crt"

  # This tells trust-manager the key to use when writing the trust
  # bundle into the ConfigMap. The target stanza doesn't have a way
  # to specify the name of the namespace, but thankfully Linkerd puts
  # a unique label on the control plane's namespace.
  target:
    configMap:
      key: "ca-bundle.crt"
    namespaceSelector:
      matchLabels:
        linkerd.io/is-control-plane: "true"
EOF
```

{{< note >}}

The Linkerd identity issuer does contain the trust anchor's public key, so we
could configure trust-manager to read the public key from the identity issuer.
That would complicate things both because trust-manager can't read information
from two namespaces and because it turns out that cert-manager won't
automatically rotate the identity issuer when we manually trigger rotation of
the trust anchor, so it's simpler to use the trust anchor Secrets directly.

{{< /note >}}

You won't actually see the `linkerd-identity-trust-roots` ConfigMap in the
`linkerd` namespace yet, because the namespace won't have the label that
trust-manager is looking for until we install Linkerd! So let's go ahead and
get Linkerd installed.

### 6. Install Linkerd using certificates created by cert-manager

To have Linkerd use the certificates created by cert-manager, you need to add
the following to your `values.yaml` file or pass them in as flags at runtime.

| Field                    | Value               |
| ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| `identity.externalCA`    | `true`              |
| `identity.issuer.scheme` | `kubernetes.io/tls` |

#### Installing with Helm (recommended)

For installing with Helm, first install the `linkerd-crds` chart:

```bash
helm install linkerd-crds \
     -n linkerd --create-namespace \
     linkerd/linkerd-crds
```

Then install the `linkerd-control-plane` chart:

```bash
helm install linkerd-control-plane -n linkerd \
  --set identity.externalCA=true \
  --set identity.issuer.scheme=kubernetes.io/tls \
  linkerd/linkerd-control-plane
```

We'll also need to label the `linkerd` namespace with the label that
trust-manager will be looking for:

```bash
kubectl label namespace linkerd linkerd.io/is-control-plane=true
```

Voila! We have set up automatic rotation of Linkerd's control plane TLS
credentials.

### Installing with the CLI

First, install the CRDs:

```bash
linkerd install --crds | kubectl apply -f -
```

Then install the control plane:

```bash
linkerd install \
  --set identity.externalCA=true \
  --set identity.issuer.scheme=kubernetes.io/tls \
  | kubectl apply -f -
```

Voila! We have set up automatic rotation of Linkerd's control plane TLS
credentials.

### 7. Check everything that cert-manager did!

You can skip this step if you're in a hurry, but it's a good idea to know how
to check Linkerd's trust setup! There are a few ways to do this, but one of
the easiest uses the [`step` CLI] to inspect the actual certificates stored in
the various Kubernetes objects that cert-manager has just set up for us.

[`step` CLI]: https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/installation

First up, let's look at the actual trust anchor secret. This is the
`linkerd-trust-anchor` Secret in the `cert-manager` namespace; `kubectl
describe` will show that it has keys of `tls.key`, `tls.crt`, and `ca.crt`:

```bash
kubectl describe secret -n cert-manager linkerd-trust-anchor
```

We won't look at `tls.key` - that's the private key! - but `tls.crt` is its
base64-encoded public key, and we can inspect that:

```bash
kubectl get secret -n cert-manager linkerd-trust-anchor \
        -o jsonpath='{ .data.tls\.crt }' \
    | base64 -d | step certificate inspect -
```

There's a lot of information in there: things worth checking over include the
`Issuer`, the `Subject`, the `Validity` timestamps, etc. But we can use a
shell function to easier to see the chain of trust where one certificate signs
another:

```bash
inspect_cert () {
  sub_selector='\(.extensions.subject_key_id | .[0:16])... \(.subject_dn)'
  iss_selector='\(.extensions.authority_key_id // "................" | .[0:16])... \(.issuer_dn)'

  step certificate inspect --format json "$1" \
    | jq -r "\"Issuer:  $iss_selector\",\"Subject: $sub_selector\""
}
```

```bash
kubectl get secret -n cert-manager linkerd-trust-anchor \
        -o jsonpath='{ .data.tls\.crt }' \
    | base64 -d | inspect_cert
```

We should see something like this:

```text {class=disable-copy}
Issuer:  ................... CN=root.linkerd.cluster.local
Subject: 5c455d3e9bd77e91... CN=root.linkerd.cluster.local
```

where the `Subject`'s key fingerprint - the hex number on the second line -
will of course be different for your certificate.

Since our setup uses a self-signed certificate (as expected!), we won't see an
issuer fingerprint, and the issuer and subject names will be the same, and the
`ca.crt` key should have exactly the same information as `tls.crt`:

```bash
kubectl get secret -n cert-manager linkerd-trust-anchor \
        -o jsonpath='{ .data.ca\.crt }' \
    | base64 -d | inspect_cert
```

This output should look _exactly_ the same as the `tls.crt` output.

Since we copied the trust anchor to the `linkerd-previous-anchor` Secret, too,
we should see _exactly_ the same information there as we do in the
`linkerd-trust-anchor` Secret:

```bash
kubectl get secret -n cert-manager linkerd-previous-anchor \
        -o jsonpath='{ .data.tls\.crt }' \
    | base64 -d | inspect_cert

kubectl get secret -n cert-manager linkerd-previous-anchor \
        -o jsonpath='{ .data.ca\.crt }' \
    | base64 -d | inspect_cert
```

{{< note >}}

Remember, if you chose to use a different kind of issuer for your trust
anchor, you should _not_ see a self-signed certificate, and `ca.crt` should
show you information about the actual key that issued your trust anchor.

{{< /note >}}

Next, we can check the identity issuer certificate. This is the
`linkerd-identity-issuer` Secret in the `linkerd` namespace, and it will
appear to have exactly the same structure as the trust anchor secret:

```bash
kubectl describe secret -n linkerd linkerd-identity-issuer
```

The `ca.crt` key should be exactly the same as what we just saw from the trust
anchor, at this point:

```bash
kubectl get secret -n linkerd linkerd-identity-issuer \
        -o jsonpath='{ .data.ca\.crt }' \
    | base64 -d | inspect_cert
```

The `tls.crt` key should be the public key of the identity issuer certificate,
so its _Issuer_ line should show the trust anchor's fingerprint, and its
_Subject_ line should be different.

```bash
kubectl get secret -n linkerd linkerd-identity-issuer \
        -o jsonpath='{ .data.tls\.crt }' \
    | base64 -d | inspect_cert
```

Here, we should see something like

```text {class=disable-copy}
Issuer:  5c455d3e9bd77e91... CN=root.linkerd.cluster.local
Subject: 56bfe071553c16ad... CN=identity.linkerd.cluster.local
```

where the `Issuer` line should be _exactly_ the same as the `Subject` line
from the previous inspections (and, again, your hex values will be different
from the ones shown above).

{{< note >}}

Even if you chose to use a different kind of issuer for your trust anchor, the
identity issuer should still show the fingerprint you saw for your trust
anchor.

{{< /note >}}

Finally, we can check the trust bundle. This is the
`linkerd-identity-trust-roots` ConfigMap in the `linkerd` namespace, and it
should have a key named `ca-bundle.crt`. This key should contain our trust
bundle, which is a set of public keys -- at the moment, there should just be
one key, the public key of our current trust anchor. This is _not_
base64-encoded, so we can start by dumping it directly:

```bash
kubectl get configmap -n linkerd linkerd-identity-trust-roots \
        -o jsonpath='{ .data.ca-bundle\.crt }'
```

This should be a single PEM CERTIFICATE block:

```text {class=disable-copy}
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
...lots of random-looking stuff here...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

and if we pipe it to `inspect_cert`, we should once again see the trust
anchor's information.

```bash
kubectl get configmap -n linkerd linkerd-identity-trust-roots \
        -o jsonpath='{ .data.ca-bundle\.crt }' \
    | inspect_cert
```

{{< note >}}

If you read carefully, you'll notice that **none** of the commands above are
interacting with anything specific to cert-manager (except that we have some
secrets stored in the `cert-manager` namespace). **Any** solution that keeps
the `linkerd-identity-issuer` Secret and `linkerd-identity-trust-roots`
ConfigMap up to date will work with Linkerd: all Linkerd needs is that those
two resources have the right information in them.

{{< /note >}}

### 8. Rotating the identity issuer

Rotating the identity issuer is basically a non-event: cert-manager can handle
rotating the identity issuer completely on its own. When it does so, it will
update the `linkerd-identity-issuer` Secret in the `linkerd` namespace, at
which point every Linkerd proxy will automatically notice this change and
start using the new certificate for issuing workload certificates. Since the
trust anchor hasn't changed, nothing further is needed and everything will
continue smoothly.

You can monitor identity issuer rotation by checking the `IssuerUpdated`
events emitted by Linkerd:

```bash
kubectl get events --field-selector reason=IssuerUpdated -n linkerd
```

{{< note >}}

If you leave cert-manager to its own devices here, **the proxies will not all
rotate their certificates the moment that cert-manager rotates the identity
issuer**. The proxies will continue using their workload certificates, signed
by the _old_ identity issuer, until it's time to rotate the workload
certificate. **This is OK under normal circumstances**, and it reduces load on
Linkerd's identity controller.

If you need to force the proxies to rotate their certificates immediately,
just restart the workloads.

### 9. Rotating the trust anchor

Rotating the trust anchor is a bit different, because (as mentioned before)
rotating the trust anchor mean that you have to restart both the Linkerd
control plane and all the proxies while managing the trust bundle. In
practice, this _requires_ manual intervention, because while cert-manager can
handle the hard work of actually rotating the trust anchor, it can't trigger
the needed restarts.

This means that the simplest way to handle trust anchor rotation is to
**trigger the rotation manually* whenever it's convenient for you so that you
can manage the trust bundle and restarts while letting cert-manager manage the
trust anchor certificate.

The process of actually doing this is straightforward, but again, there are
several steps:

1. Trigger trust anchor rotation
2. Trigger identity issuer rotation
3. Restart the control plane
4. Restart the data plane
5. Remove the old anchor from the trust bundle

{{< note >}}

It's worth noting that the trust anchor's private key is used less than any
other key in the system: when set up correctly, it's used _only_ to rotate the
identity issuer, which happens relatively infrequently and may in fact be
happening entirely off the cluster! This means that you should think carefully
about whether you need to rotate the trust anchor at all: depending on your
threat model and security requirements, it might make sense to simply let the
trust anchor live as long as the cluster.

#### 1. Triggering trust anchor rotation

Start by triggering cert-manager to rotate the trust anchor. The easiest way
to do this is with cert-manager's `cmctl` CLI:

```bash
cmctl renew -n cert-manager linkerd-trust-anchor
```

This will cause cert-manager to rotate the trust anchor certificate, which
will update the `linkerd-trust-anchor` Secret, which will trigger
trust-manager to update the `linkerd-identity-trust-roots` ConfigMap. You can
(and should!) check both of these things with `kubectl` -- the
`linkerd-trust-anchor` and `linkerd-previous-anchor` should no longer show the
same Subject keys:

```bash
kubectl get secret -n cert-manager linkerd-trust-anchor \
        -o jsonpath='{ .data.tls\.crt }' \
    | base64 -d | inspect_cert

kubectl get secret -n cert-manager linkerd-previous-anchor \
        -o jsonpath='{ .data.tls\.crt }' \
    | base64 -d | inspect_cert
```

Additionally, the `linkerd-identity-trust-roots` ConfigMap should now contain
the Subject keys from both Secrets. (We can't use `inspect_cert` for this
since there are two keys.)

```bash
kubectl get configmap -n linkerd linkerd-identity-trust-roots \
        -o jsonpath='{ .data.ca-bundle\.crt }' \
        | step certificate inspect --bundle --format json \
        | jq -r ".[] | \"Subject: \(.extensions.subject_key_id | .[0:16])... \(.subject_dn)\""
```

Note that mTLS communication is still working fine at this point. All the
proxies in the data plane are still using the old identity issuer, signed by
the old trust anchor, and that trust anchor is still present in
`linkerd-identity-trust-roots`.

#### 2. Triggering identity issuer rotation

Everything is still using the old identity issuer because, strangely, manually
triggering cert-manager to rotate the trust anchor does not automatically
rotate the identity issuer. You can verify this by doublechecking the identity
issuer directly:

```bash
kubectl get secret -n linkerd linkerd-identity-issuer \
        -o jsonpath='{ .data.tls\.crt }' \
    | base64 -d | inspect_cert
```

You'll see that its issuer is still the old trust anchor. Our next step,
therefore, is to trigger cert-manager to rotate the identity issuer.

```bash
cmctl renew -n linkerd linkerd-identity-issuer
```

If you re-check the identity issuer now, you'll see that it's signed by the
new trust anchor:

```bash
kubectl get secret -n linkerd linkerd-identity-issuer \
        -o jsonpath='{ .data.tls\.crt }' \
    | base64 -d | inspect_cert
```

#### 3. Restart the control plane

Restart the control plane with `kubectl rollout restart`:

```bash
kubectl rollout restart -n linkerd deploy
kubectl rollout status -n linkerd deploy
```

This will cause the control plane to pick up the new trust anchor and identity
issuer.

#### 4. Restart the data plane

At this point, you'll need to restart your workloads as well, to force the
proxies to switch to the new identity issuer. The exact mechanism to do this
when depend on your workloads, but it's often just `kubectl rollout restart`
for each of your application namespaces.

#### 5. Remove the old anchor from the trust bundle

One last step: once everything is restarted, you'll need to remove the old
trust anchor from the trust bundle. To do this, just copy the
`linkerd-trust-anchor` Secret to the `linkerd-previous-anchor` Secret; that
will trigger trust-manager to update the trust bundle ConfigMap.

{{< note >}}

If you're keeping the trust anchor's private key off the cluster entirely, the
trust anchor might be stored in some resource other than a Secret. In that
case, you'll need to modify this command to do the right thing for your
resource type.

{{< /note >}}

```bash
kubectl get secret -n cert-manager linkerd-trust-anchor -o yaml \
        | sed -e s/linkerd-trust-anchor/linkerd-previous-anchor/ \
        | egrep -v '^  *(resourceVersion|uid)' \
        | kubectl apply -f -
```

You can doublecheck this with `kubectl` again:

```bash
kubectl get configmap -n linkerd linkerd-identity-trust-roots \
        -o jsonpath='{ .data.ca-bundle\.crt }' \
        | step certificate inspect --format json \
        | jq -r "\"Subject: \(.extensions.subject_key_id | .[0:16])... \(.subject_dn)\""
```

and you should only see the single ID of the current trust anchor.

At this point rotation is complete: everything is using the new trust anchor,
and the old trust anchor is no longer trusted.
